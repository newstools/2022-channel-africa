It was the second time he had submitted a work for the prize, and he had no "expectation of winning", he told the BBC. He just wanted to practice and improve his writing. Ntsika Kota, who is a trained chemist, wrote a story called And the Earth Drank Deep about the first human murder in pre-historic times. He said his prize-winning story, was inspired by a thought that popped into his head: "Who was the first serial killer and how would they have behaved?" He told Focus on Africa that his love for writing was "first ignited in school" but he decided to pursue science for further study because it was something he felt he "had to do". --BBC--
