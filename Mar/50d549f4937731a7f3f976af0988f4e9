McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut. McDonald's said the move was a response to the "needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine". The company said it was "impossible to predict" when it would reopen. "The conflict in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis in Europe has caused unspeakable suffering to innocent people," Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in a memo to staff that was shared publicly. "As a system, we join the world in condemning aggression and violence and praying for peace." McDonald's said it would continue to pay its roughly 62 000 staff in Russia. The firm has also been experiencing supply chain issues there. McDonald's, Coca-Cola and other companies have been under pressure to act as Russian violence against civilians has escalated. #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola were trending on Twitter on Monday and over the weekend respectively. Dozens of well-known firms including Netflix and Levi's have already suspended sales or stopped providing services in Russia amid severe sanctions imposed by Western allies. McDonald's established its presence in Moscow in 1990, as the Soviet Union was opening its economy, drawing thousands for its burgers and fries. As tensions with the West increased in 2014 over Russia's annexation of Crimea, some of its restaurants were shut as part of an investigation into food standards, which many saw as politically motivated. The closure now likewise carries symbolic weight, and is likely to influence other firms. --BBC--
