The launch of Jamii represents its regional environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy, which is anchored on plans to preserve water, manage waste and empower women and youth economically. “Whether it is giving people access to safe drinking water, creating economic opportunities for people in dire need of it, or reducing the impact of our operations on the environment, we are committed to making that difference,” Coca-Cola Company’s Africa President Bruno Pietracci said in a statement. “This is a total refresh of what we’ve done but a lot of it is building on the capabilities and achievements, success that we’ve had in the past,” Vice President for Public Affairs, Communication and Sustainability Patricia Obozuwa said. With water being the global beverages brand’s lifeline, it has become imperative for it to find ways to preserve this natural resource. This is especially necessary in African continent, which is a water-scarce continent. Acknowledging the important role water plays for its business and for the development of the continent, the group’s AOU division has committed itself to replenishing 100% of the volume of water it uses to manufacture its beverages. To build on this success, the company looks to continue to find more efficient methods of water usage such as recycling or reusing water in markets where its technologies allow, ensuring more sustainable growth. It further committed to the preservation of natural water resources on the continent and to improve its supporting communities’ access to water. Geared towards creating an inclusive economy, Jamii will focus on catalysing job creation by supporting women and youth in entrepreneurship. “Women have been proven to be key to the success and flourishing societies, so if we don’t support the women to earn a living from their skills, we are doing a great disservice for the progress that we could make in Africa where economic inclusion is concerned,” Obozuwa said. --Moneyweb--
