The meeting comes within the framework of strengthening economic relations with African countries, in light of the country’s 2030 development vision, where both ministers addressed ways to enhance bilateral co-operation across different sectors. Al-Mashat explained that the Ministry of International Co-operation is working to promote joint development between Egypt and the African continent by pushing for regional integration, and by enhancing expertise and knowledge-sharing while spotlighting Egypt’s own development experiences with other African countries. This is in light of the political leadership’s commitment to strengthening relations and supporting areas of development across the continent. The event witnessed the participation of decision-makers at the local, regional and international levels, including ministers and representatives from several countries such as Senegal, Rwanda, South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon, as well as representatives from multilateral and bilateral development partners, and from the private sector. The forum also addressed promoting triangular cooperation, and south-south co-operation.  --EgyptToday--
