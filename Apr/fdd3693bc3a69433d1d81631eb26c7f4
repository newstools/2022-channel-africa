The Krinik violence was caused by an individual dispute sparked by the fighting between Arab nomads and members of the Massalit community, according to non-governmental organisations. An aid worker in Geneina told the BBC they were in hiding and that gunfire could be heard across the city. Many of those fleeing the southern neighbourhoods of Geneina have already been displaced in the past three years. Many panicking families were trying to run to safety as they left their huts and tents in internally displaced people's (IDP) camps in the southern parts of the city, the aid worker said. Krinik itself was attacked in December last year with dozens killed and injured. A Spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) told the BBC the area was restive of late, and the road to Geneina had become increasingly dangerous. Commenting on the attack on Krinik, Mathilde Vu of the NRC said she had no final tally of the three-day attack. She confirmed that groups of displaced people in Geneina were seeking safety by moving to safer settlements in the city. --BBC--
