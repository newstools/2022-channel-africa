The two men, Reverend John Mark Cheitnum and Reverend Donatus Cleopas were seized at gunpoint at a rectory in the village of Yadin Garu in Kaduna State after having travelled there for a church event. Kaduna’s Commissioner of Police (titles in caps), Ayoku Yekini, told the BBC a rescue operation was underway with security forces ‘‘on the trail’’ of the kidnappers. It is not yet clear who kidnapped the priests. Reverend Hayab said the local church could not afford the ransom being demanded. It was initially set at 50 million Naira ($120 000) but had been negotiated down to 40 million ($94 270) Naira. --BBC--
