The Copper Queens were beaten 1-0 on Monday after Linda Motlhalo converted a contentious 94th-minute penalty, which was awarded following a video assistant referee (VAR) check. Ethiopian referee, Lidya Tafesse, consulted her pitchside monitor and decided that Martha Tembo had fouled Jermaine Seoposenwe. Zambia coach, Bruce Mwape, queried the purpose of VAR after the match, while the country's President Hakainde Hichilema said it was a "questionable penalty". Faz has lodged an official complaint with Wafcon organisers the Confederation of African Football, highlighting "six key incidences" as grounds for a replay. "We wish to contest the decision of the referee to award such a penalty as we call for a serious review of the game," Faz's letter of appeal said. "We call for the penalty to be cancelled, that a replay be ordered and that the referee be barred from handling any (further) games." --BBC--
