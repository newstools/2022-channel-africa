The Congolese M23 rebels took over the town on Monday after forcing some government soldiers to flee to neighbouring Uganda. The strategic town is vital to cross-border trade between DRC and Uganda. In a statement, North Kivu provincial authorities said the “Rwandan army decided to violate the integrity of our territory and occupy the town of Bunagana”. They called the capture of the town “an invasion of DRC” and added that the army “will defend the nation”. Rwanda has repeatedly called the crisis in eastern DRC “an internal affair” and denied supporting M23 rebels. Its army has not commented on the fall of Bunagana, but in a statement on Tuesday said it would ensure the integrity of Rwanda’s territory. Tension between the two armies has risen after they accused each other of cross-border bombing activities over the weekend. --BBC--
