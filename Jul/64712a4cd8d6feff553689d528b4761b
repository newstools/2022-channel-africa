Dos Santos died on July 8, aged 79, having made history by becoming President at the age of 37, and leaving the seat in 2017, 38 years later. However, the family has squabbled with Angolan authorities on whether he should be buried in Angola or Barcelona, where he was living. The family had earlier said their father wished to be buried in Spain. But in a letter signed by five of dos Santos’ children, they also expressed "deep gratitude to the people of Angola" and to all those who share in their sadness and call for respect for the mourning. "We, (the) children of Engineer dos Santos, call on everyone to respect our customs, our ancestral values and our religious beliefs”, the letter reads. “Dos Santos has this right, and no one can contest it. In African tradition, the time of mourning is a time for reflection and reconciliation”. The letter, signed by Isabel, José Filomeno Zenú, Welwitschia Tchizé, Joess and José Eduardo Paulino Coreon Dú, adds that they also want a mausoleum to house dos Santos’ mortal remains. The letter could allow authorities to now arrange for his State funeral. But it also signals that the family wants assurances that the government will not target them after the burial. Some of dos Santos’ children had been staying away from Angola, like dos Santos, after the new government of President Joao Lourenco opened corruption investigations into how they amassed wealth. --TheEastAfrican--
