A new report from both organisations say manufacturers had engaged in what it called misleading practices. It is well known that breastfeeding gives infants their better start in life but despite a 40 year old international agreement design to protect new mothers from aggressive marketing. The formula milk industry is today worth $55 billion. The new report says the industry is guilty of systematic unethical and misleading marketing, offering new mothers free samples suggesting breast milk is not nutritious and formulas keep babies full for longer. --BBC--
