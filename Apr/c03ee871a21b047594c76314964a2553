The new curriculum which was approved by the Higher Education Examinations Council, and accepted for use by the Ministry of Health and Child Care, will improve public health and food safety knowledge, behaviours, attitudes, and skills of Zimbabwe's public health officers. The development of the curriculum for environmental health technicians is part of FAO’s interventions in the framework of the project financed by the European Union (EU), “Transforming animal health and sanitation and plant health (SPS)/food safety Zimbabwe’s Food (FS) for the Future” (SAFE).
