Chimphondah joins a list of executives who have left the Pan-African housing financier abruptly or under a cloud of controversy. “Reporting to the Shelter Afrique Board of Directors, the Managing Director has overall responsibility for the implementation of Shelter Afrique’s mandate to mobilise resources for the development of housing and related infrastructure in Africa,” said the agency in a notice. “In collaboration with private and public sector institutions, he/she will identify, develop and implement housing and related infrastructure projects, mobilise the required resources, manage them and apply them prudently to enable Shelter Afrique to achieve its mandate.” Chimphondah, who took over the helm three-and-a-half years ago, had been tasked with steering its turnaround following tumultuous years that saw it pushed into a financial crisis. The board did not disclose why the Zimbabwean national was let go, only stating that the housing lender is transitioning. Shelter Afrique, owned by 44 African countries and three development institutions, African Development Bank, African Reinsurance Corporation and the African Solidarity Fund, has had three CEOs in less than eight years. Chimphondah joined the housing financier in September 2018, taking over from Sierra Leone national Femi Adewole, who served for less than two years in an acting capacity and then as substantive Managing Director since early 2017. The firm last year said it completed the repayment of the balance of $186 million owed to eight lenders three years ahead of schedule. Shelter Afrique is eyeing to roll out its planned issuance of $1.25 billion worth of new bonds from African capital markets. It will be seeking $500 million from East Africa and a similar amount from Nigeria, with the remaining $250 million coming from its francophone markets. --TheEastAfrican--
