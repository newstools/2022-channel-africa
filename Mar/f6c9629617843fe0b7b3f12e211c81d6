Mozambique has recorded its first day of zero Covid-19 infections in addition to zero Covid-19 deaths on Monday and zero hospitalisation in 24 hours throughout the country. Some 18 people were still recovering from Covid-19. This milestone is a first since the pandemic started. Since March 2020  225 140 infections and 2 196 died after contracting the virus. The authorities attributed the zero cases to the mass vaccination campaign and the public compliance with the social distancing rules. Their adherence to mask wearing and hand washing also contributed to the record zero Covid-19 infection. The government launched the mass vaccination campaign last year, targeting to inoculate seventeen million inhabitants by late December 2021. As of March 5, 2022, a total of 23 563 858 vaccine doses have been administered. --AfricaNews--
