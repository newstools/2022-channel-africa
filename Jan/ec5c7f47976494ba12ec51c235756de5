E-commerce and postal services were highlighted at a January 5 press conference at the Universal Postal Union during a changing of the guard when the new director-general Masahiko Metoki introduced himself at the UPU headquarters in the Swiss capital Bern. Metoki, from Japan, was sworn in after being voted in as the new UPU head at a Covid-delayed conference in Abidjan in August to replace Kenyan Bishar A. Hussein, who had served in the position from 2013. "Because of the experience of Covid-19, we now have new opportunities, such as the development of remote communications and also the outstanding improvement of e-commerce," said Metoki. "This time has not been easy, especially for developing countries. Because of Covid-19, we have realized the importance of the social responsibility of postal operations," said the new global postal chief. --AllAfrica--
