On Monday fighting spread from a town near Geneina, the capital of West Darfur. The EU Foreign Policy Chief, Josep Borrell has now called for plans to set up a joint military force with rebels who signed a peace deal. A United Nations peacekeeping force withdrew from Darfur after its mandate expired at the end of 2020. Since then there have been frequent outbreaks of inter-communal violence involving well-armed militias. --BBC--
