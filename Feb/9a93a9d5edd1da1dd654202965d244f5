A security guard in an area near the Zambezi regional capital, Katima Muliro, was last week killed by a hippo, the state broadcaster NBC quoted the police as saying. Wildlife authorities have urged residents to take caution and report any sighting of tracks of wild animals instead of following them. In the last two weeks, stray hippos have been spotted in maize fields and water pools near residential areas in Zambezi region. The authorities believe the hippos are coming from the Zambezi River. --BBC--
