Today marks two years since the announcement of the National State of Disaster to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his State-of-the-Nation address last month that he intended to end the National State of Disaster after finalising all measures under the National Health Act to manage the pandemic. With almost 100 000 people now having succumbed to the pandemic in South Africa and as government thinks of doing away with the lockdown regulations, the President stressed the importance of vaccination. At least 43% of the population is now fully vaccinated after government failed to meet its self-imposed target of having 70% of the adult population vaccinated by the end of last year.  --SABC--
