The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which manages the German capital’s museums, said it would return the female figure, known as Ngonnso, to the Nso community in north-west Cameroon. The statue was taken by a colonial officer and donated to Berlin’s Ethnological Museum in 1903. A Nso Kingdom Prince told the Reuters news agency that the news was warmly received in Cameroon. "After more than 120 years, we can only remain happy for it is a moment to commemorate and come closer to our ancestral links with love and togetherness,” Mbinglo Gilles Yumo Nyuydzewira is quoted as saying. The foundation also said that it will return 23 pieces to Namibia and is planning an agreement to repatriate objects to Tanzania. --BBC--
