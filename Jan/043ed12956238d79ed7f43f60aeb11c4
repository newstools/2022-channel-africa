UAE left Kenya and Tanzania out in its latest review, which saw Ghana, Angola, Uganda, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire allowed admission to the middle-eastern state. “Emirates will resume passenger services to and from Guinea (CKY), Cote d’Ivoire (ABJ), Ghana (ACC), Uganda (EBB) and Republic of Angola (Luanda),” reads a statement from the carrier’s website. The aviation regulator told the Business Daily last week that Dubai had asked Kenya to put its house in order first before it could review the flight ban, which was reciprocated by Nairobi in kind last week. Before the ban last week, Emirates was bringing into Kenya passengers from Dubai and flew cargo on its way back using the same passenger jets, a move that angered local aviators. The conflict will hurt the two airlines, especially the ailing Kenya Airways (KQ) that is struggling financially. Kenya had from November to December seen coronavirus resurgence with a rapidly rising caseload since confirmation of the highly infectious Omicron variant last year. The country has, however, in the last one week recorded a fall in the positivity rate declining to 13% on Thursday from a high of more than 30% at the beginning of the year. The surge in global coronavirus infections has seen many countries tighten restrictions to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. The World Health Organisation (WHO) labels a country to be a high risk if the positivity rate rises above 5% and advises countries to consider restrictions if it remains above the limit for at least 14 days. --TheCitizen--
