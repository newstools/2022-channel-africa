The department says 28 of the 34 South Africans including students that were in war-ravaged Ukraine have safely crossed the border into neighbouring countries. South Africans caught up in the crossfire in Ukraine tell SABC News about their traumatic experience, fleeing Ukrainian cities that are under siege. Some feel that South Africa’s government could have done more to help citizens in life-threatening situation. Hundreds of thousands of people have been fleeing the East European nation following Russia’s invasion. Department Spokesperson, Clayson Monyela says more South Africans will begin to make their way home soon. “As we speak today, we had arrivals of four students who were in Hungary and have arrived back in South Africa. Tomorrow, we are expecting one and the day after is another four. “People are starting to make their way back to South Africa. There are two students that are in a town that is far remote. It’s actually closest to Russia. We are talking to relevant people to create a safe passage for them.” The Department of International Relations has urged all South Africans who might have family members unaccounted for in Ukraine to contact them. The department says it’s working with its ambassadors in countries bordering Ukraine and South African nationals in Europe to provide a safe passage for all citizens. “In Romania we got three and in Poland the number now is 13. The call that we continue to make to South Africans is that if there’s a member of your family in Ukraine unaccounted for please let us know.” Minister of International Relations Dr Naledi Pandor has raised concern over reports of racism coming out of Europe as people try to flee the Russia-Ukraine conflict. She is using the opportunity of the visit to participate in the High-Level Segment of the 49th Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, to launch South Africa’s campaign for membership of the Human Rights Council for the period 2023-2025. --SABC--
