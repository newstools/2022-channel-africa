The Aspen Pharmacare facility, manufacturing vaccines, was launched last year but to date, it has not received a single order from other countries. Only 30% of the country’s population has also been vaccinated, with a fifth wave of Covid-19 looming.

We will also be engaging with the rest of the world to procure vaccines made in Africa.” --SABC--
