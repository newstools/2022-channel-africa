Tanzania, which is the 4th largest producer of rice in Africa and the second-largest in Eastern and Southern Africa, has put in place plans and measures to increase rice production annually in an effort to reach a tipping point in 2030 and thus be able to feed the region and beyond, according to the Director of the Mechanisation Division in the Ministry of Agriculture, Anna Mwangamilo. “We have adopted a transformative technology-dependent agricultural system model for rice, which includes mass adoption of improved seeds usage and other tools, including modern irrigation,” Mwangamilo told journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday. She noted the provision of substantial market opportunities for smallholder farmers in the last three years, has led to assured national self-sufficiency and a sizeable surplus for export, making rice one of the most significant cash crops in Tanzania. Implementation of the strategy by the government and the private sector has enhanced rice production and trade competitiveness. The strategy seeks to increase production to at least 8.8 million tonnes by 2030. Development partners, including Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (Agra) and others, have also played a role in catalysing business-driven increased productivity. Mwangamilo, appreciated Agra and USAID’s supported African Rice Initiative in East Africa (CARI-EA), noting that it has set a good precedent for improving the rice value chain and making it more profitable for farmers and other players. The crop alongside maize is strategic cereal, as per Agricultural Sector Development. --TheCitizen--
