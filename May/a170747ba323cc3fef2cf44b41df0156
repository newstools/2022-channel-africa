Malema was addressing the May Day rally in Middelburg, Mpumalanga. He said people should not be divided by borders created by a person. Recently, the country has seen a rise in anti-immigrant sentiments in the townships which has left foreign nationals fearing for their safety. This largely led by Operation Dudula which has accused Malema of supporting illegal migrants. Malema has called on people to protect one another as Africans and be united. “Stop the hate of black people, love each other, before you love each other, love yourself. Hey, you can take your vote if you hate me for loving black people. I don’t want to be a President of people who hate black people. I want to be a President of black people who love themselves and other black people.”
