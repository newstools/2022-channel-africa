One of the agreements is on the establishment of a joint commission for cooperation, while the six others are Memoranda of Understanding on political and diplomatic consultations, trade and Investment, cooperation in wildlife tourism, gender equality and women empowerment, agriculture, and arts and youth affairs. The agreements were signed during a bilateral meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Sierra Leone counterpart Julius Maada Bio at State House Nairobi on Monday morning. A 21-gun salute and a guard of honour was mounted by the Kenya Air Force as part of the visiting president’s welcome honours. At the meeting, President Kenyatta said the two countries need to strengthen relations for their full potential to be harnessed and used for the benefit of both countries. President Bio arrived in the country on Saturday night for a five-day state visit upon the invitation of President Kenyatta and was received at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs Raychelle Omamo. Kenya is one of the African Union Member States that contributed troops to the then United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) between 1999 and 2006. Kenyan troops were deployed under the KENBATT contingents and five soldiers died in the war. President Bio read all their names at the event in Nairobi, saying that the history of peace in Sierra Leone would be incomplete without a prominent mention of the soldiers’ “valour and selfless service.” --TheEastAfrican--
