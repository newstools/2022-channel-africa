The provincial Department of Health said tests conducted at a laboratory in Cape Town found alcohol and carbon monoxide in the victims' blood but not at deadly levels. It said methanol was also found but further testing was under way to determine the levels. Twenty-one young people, mostly teenagers, were found dead last month in the coastal city of East London, in the Eastern Cape province. The owner of the bar and two of his employees have been charged with breaching regulations regarding sales of alcohol.  --BBC--
