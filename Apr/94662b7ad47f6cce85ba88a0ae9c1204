The union said it received a revised offer from the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council and its affiliates in the bus passenger sector. NUMSA said employers have proposed a 4.5% increase across the board, including allowances. They have also agreed to withdraw the threat of implementing increases only for those workers who are currently employed as of March 31, 2022. “In the meantime, we will be engaging our members to find out how they feel about the proposal. We want to make it clear that the possibility of strike action remains, as long as we have not signed an agreement with the employer”, said NUMSA Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola. Hlubi-Majola said they will be spending the next couple of days engaging with union members all over the country in order to get a mandate on the proposed offer. NUMSA will meet again with employers on April 22 to give them feedback.  --SABC--
