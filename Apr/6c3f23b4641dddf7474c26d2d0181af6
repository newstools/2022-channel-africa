Ramaphosa says there have been notable successes in the fight against terrorism in Mozambique. Ramaphosa says the SADC extraordinary organ summit on the current situation in the neighbouring country has directed the head of the mission to co-ordinate with Mozambique to implement the comprehensive Integrated Reconstruction and Development Plan of Cabo Delgado. “The ministerial committee of the organ had also directed SADC Secretariat to convene a meeting to develop the SAMIM exit strategy. We wish to express our appreciation and commend the work of SAMIM on the ground. “I equally appreciate and commend member states for having deployed personnel and equipment to support our work in Mozambique,” adds Ramaphosa. --SABC--
