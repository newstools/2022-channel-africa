Six Senegalese players contracted Covid-19 before the team even left for Cameroon earlier this month. Then on January 9, the day the 24-team tournament started, Senegal’s football federation said that two more players, goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and striker Famara Diedhiou were also positive. “Saliou Ciss, Pape Matar Sarr and Nampalis Mendy will join the den this Thursday after a negative PCR test done today,” the statement said. Captain Kalidou Koulibaly, sidelined with the virus, could return for the Guinea game after receiving a negative test result on Tuesday. He will need another negative result on Thursday, a source in the team said. Senegal, runners-up in the 2019 competition, narrowly won their first game on Monday against Zimbabwe, with Liverpool’s Sadio Mane scoring a penalty deep into injury time. The team’s third and final group game is against Malawi on January 18. --Reuters--
