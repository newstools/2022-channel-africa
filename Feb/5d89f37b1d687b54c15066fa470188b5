The announcement formed part of South African Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana’s maiden budget speech tabled yesterday.The scheme will come into effect in March to support small-to-medium enterprises (SME) that have suffered distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Finance Minister announced that the scheme will include a business equity-linked loan guarantee scheme. “Firstly, small business loan guarantees of $98 million will be facilitated through participating banks and development finance institutions. “This allows access for qualifying non-bank small and medium loan providers…” says Godongwana. He added: “Government will partner with loan providers by underwriting the first 20% of losses for banks and other eligible small and medium loan providers. The eligibility criteria, including the requirement for collateral, have been loosened.” Markets and businesses have welcomed Godongwana’s budget that provides personal income tax relief and reduced the tax burden on corporates. It also reprioritised government spending and committed to reducing the government’s salary bill and shifting allocations towards goods and services aimed at improving service delivery. Spending on infrastructure like roads, rails, and ports has also been increased. --SABC--
