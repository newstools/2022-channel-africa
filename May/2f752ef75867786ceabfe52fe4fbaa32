Members of Parliaments from the country's upper and lower houses of parliament will choose the next President on May 15. President Mohamed Abdullahi "Farmajo" is seeking a second term but faces stiff competition from several candidates including two former Presidents. The election was postponed by more than a year because of a power struggle between Farmajo and the Prime Minister, Mohamed Hussein Roble. The timing of the vote ensures Somalia does not miss out on a $400 million financial package from the International Monetary Fund. It is set to expire unless a new administration is in place by May 17. --BBC--
