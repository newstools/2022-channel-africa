This follows the latest report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), that there has been a surge in vaccine-preventable diseases over the past year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Head of Child Health Unit at the Department of Health, Dr Lesley Bamford, says there has not been a measles surge specific to South Africa yet. “The figures that were quoted by the WHO and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund are the global figures. “So there certainly has been an increase in a number of cases globally. So, certainly, we are concerned and need to be alert to the possibilities and are monitoring carefully,” explains Bamford. --SABC--
