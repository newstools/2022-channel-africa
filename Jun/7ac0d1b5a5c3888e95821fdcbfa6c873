The State Capture Commission's last two parts of its report made a number of findings against the current President on decisions he made and actions he took while Deputy President. One of the findings is that Ramaphosa should have spoken out to protest rampant corruption during the tenure of former President Jacob Zuma. The commission report also pointed out that Ramaphosa didn't do enough to stop the theft of tens of billions of rands of taxpayer funds. Presidential spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said Ramaphosa had given evidence in April 2021 in his role as President of the African National Congress. “As part of his evidence and in his written submission, the President outlined in detail the options he had considered as Deputy President in response to emerging evidence of state capture, and the efforts he has led as President to stop the abuse of public resources and rebuild key institutions.” “Ramaphosa has committed to consider the Commission’s report in its totality and to present a comprehensive response and implementation plan to Parliament. The Presidency will therefore not respond at this stage to specific aspects of the Commission’s findings and recommendations,” Magwenya said. The final State capture report has exposed a series of glaring gaps in Ramaphosa’s testimony on the widespread looting of State resources. --ChannelAfrica--
