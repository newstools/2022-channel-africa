The arts fraternity mourns the loss of the poetic giant who was also buried on the same day according to Muslim rites. Throughout his career, he served as a writer, journalist and anti-apartheid activist. The National Poet Laureate of South Africa, Professor Wally Serote, worked closely with Mattera over the years and says Mattera dedicated his life to mentoring young people. Mattera’s autobiography: "Memory is a weapon", celebrates life in Sophiatown in the 1950's. He was an outspoken critic of apartheid and spent eight years under house arrest. He used poetry to express what was happening in South Africa during apartheid. Meanwhile, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa Mattera’s death comes at a time when the country is facing numerous challenges. Ramaphosa says Mattera will be remembered as a patriot who fought for the rights of all South Africans. --SABC--
