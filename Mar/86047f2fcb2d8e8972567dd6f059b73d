In February, Malawi reported its first case of wild poliovirus in the country in 30 years.  

According to a United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) statement an immunisation drive kicked off in Malawi on Sunday and will be followed on Thursday with campaigns starting in neighboring Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia.  

This first round will target over 9 million children in the four countries.  

Three more rounds, in which Zimbabwe will also take part, are set for April, June and July.  

The campaigns are being led by the respective governments and supported by UNICEF, the World Health Organisation and other partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
