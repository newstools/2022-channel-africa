The country’s Department of Social Development launched the week-long campaign in Lusikisiki, in the Eastern Cape province. 

This year, the focus is on teenage pregnancy, which saw a spike during Covid-19 lockdown period, with high numbers of teenagers giving birth in 2021. National Child Protection Week is observed in South Africa annually to raise awareness about the rights of children as articulated in the Children's Act of 2005. 

Speaking to the SABC during the launch, Deputy Minister for Social Development, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, says adult men are mainly responsible for teenage pregnancies. 

On the back of that, Save the Children Programme Director, Gugu Xaba, says it's important for parents to have discussions, with their children, on sexual issues and how to look after their bodies. Xaba says in 2020 alone, more than 600 children between the ages of 10-13 gave birth. 

Meanwhile, Advocacy Manager at Women and Men Against Child Abuse, Nga Morombedzi, says poverty is the biggest contributor of statutory rape in South Africa. 

Bogopane-Zulu has urged communities to report cases of statutory rape against those who sleep with and impregnate underage girls. Morombedzi says kids as young as 10-years-old, are not in any position to give consent to any sexual behaviour.
