After the gunfire subsided at around 6 AM (8 AM Central African Time) helicopters circled above the Kati base, which is about 15 kilometres from Bamako. A convoy carrying the leader of Mali's junta, Colonel Assimi Goita, sped away from his house in Kati in the direction of Bamako, a Reuters reporter said. It is not clear who was behind the violence and the military-led government has so far not commented on the incident. --Reuters/BBC--
