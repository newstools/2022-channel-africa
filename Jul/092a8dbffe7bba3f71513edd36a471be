The annual event in New York comes after the General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2009 declaring Madiba's birthday, July the 18, an international day in his name. It will feature interventions from people including New York City's Mayor Eric Adams, Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed and Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele. Prince Harry's inclusion created media frenzy around this year's General Assembly event. -- Sherwin Bryce-Pease/SABC--
