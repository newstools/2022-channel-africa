The former President of Mozambique, Armando Guebuza, as Commander-in-Chief, assumed yesterday in Court all the responsibilities on the creation of EMATUM and MAM and even the Exclusive Economic Zone. "I am Chief. I assume all responsibilities. I led a meeting that produced Yes, I do. I assume that responsibility and of having created the Exclusive Economic Zone. I was the President of the country, I wanted to defend the whole country and you too," he justified. Prosecutor Ana Sheila Marrengula questioned the former Head of State whether the Joint Command discussed only the creation of Proindidcus or whether this body at some point discussed and decided the creation of the companies Ematum and MAM: "Does the declarant remember there having been meetings led by your excellency in which decisions were taken for the creation of the companies Ematum SA, MAM SA?" For the purpose of the negotiations for financing Guebuza replied that all responsibilities were entrusted to the chiefs who were part of the Joint Command. "I made an order I don't remember in what terms it was made in which I delegated the negotiating powers to the Chiefs. The Minister of Defence, the Minister of the Interior and the Director-General of State Information and Security Services," he clarified. Regarding the guarantees of $500 million in favour of MAM, Armando Geubuza denied having authorised Finance Minister Manuel Chang, who is awaiting extradition in South Africa, and referred the answer to the Minister himself. "I think the one who should answer this is the Minister himself, who is not here. He would be the one to answer and not me. Based on what he wrote that doesn't even mention my name. I have no knowledge", he said. --ChannelAfrica--
