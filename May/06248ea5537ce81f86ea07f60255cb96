The Director of Public Health at the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Dr Franklin Asiedu Bekoe, told the BBC the circulating reports on social media about a possible outbreak in the country are false. “We haven’t confirmed any monkey pox in Ghana” Bekoe revealed. According to GHS, one individual reported to a medical facility in the Ahanta West Region with blisters. Initial assessment of the case however is not suggestive of monkey pox. Health officials in the country say further investigations are underway into the case. Meanwhile, officials say Ghana has enhanced surveillance activities regarding monkey pox following a recent outbreak of the virus in Europe, Australia and America. --BBC--
