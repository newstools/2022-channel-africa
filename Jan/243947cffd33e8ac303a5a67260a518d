The operation will cost $29.5 million. The SADC Military Mission was supposed to end its mandate on January 15. The decision to extend the military mission for another three months was taken during the extraordinary SADC summit held this Wednesday in Lilongwe, Malawi. For Mozambique's President, Filipe Nyusi, the recently-held SADC summit was a success. Speaking at the end of the summit, Nyusi said the mandate of the SADC Military Mission was extended with the possibility of extending it for longer, stressing that the next phase is decisive in the fight against terrorism. During the summit, it was also announced that Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa will provide food to those displaced in Cabo Delgado due to the terrorist attacks. Incidentally, the SADC commended Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe for committing to provide food to alleviate the suffering faced by internally displaced persons in Cabo Delgado Province. More than a million people are starving because of the conflict. The Summit also welcomed the initiative to convene an International Conference to support the economic and social reconstruction of the Cabo Delgado Province and called on international cooperation partners to support the initiative. --ChannelAfrica/Jacob Tivane--
