Kenya Airways Chairperson Michael Joseph told the BusinessDaily while the pact is a long-term agreement, both airlines are in talks to jointly expedite the implementation of common business plans to gain a competitive edge over rivals. “We are already talking about some initiatives we can implement sooner,” Joseph said in an interview without disclosing the cited immediate common business plans. The two carriers signed a Strategic Partnership Framework in South Africa last November, in a move that will see the two carriers eventually form a Pan-African carrier amid common longstanding financial woes exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is expected that the partnership will improve the financial viability of the two airlines. Customers will also benefit from more competitive price offerings for both passenger and cargo segments. Both KQ and SAA have been loss-making for years. --TheEastAfrican--
