The demonstration was organised by the National Journalists' Union (SNJT) which has condemned authorities' attempts to "tame" media outlets and turn them into propaganda channels. Protesters carried signs saying "our liberty depends on freedom of the press" and shouted slogans against "repression". In 2021 Saied sacked the government and suspended parliament, and has since dissolved the assembly, ruled by decree and seized control of key state institutions including the judiciary and the electoral authority. Saied's move initially won support from Tunisians tired of the country's post-revolution political system, but rights groups have warned of major setbacks to freedoms in the birthplace of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. The SNJT's Deputy Chief, Amira Mohamed, warned of an "imminent danger to press freedom" in Tunisia. "Today press freedom is genuinely threatened," she told AFP. --AfricaNews--
