On Tuesday, the World Bank confirmed that it had approved almost $50 million for South Africa to help it to finance COVID-19 vaccine procurement. This project will retroactively finance the procurement of 47 million COVID-19 vaccine doses. In January this year, the bank also approved South Africa’s request for an $71 million loan to assist with the country’s economic recovery plan in the wake of the pandemic. National Treasury Acting Director-General, Ismail Momoniat, says, “the amount from the World Bank loan is to support COVID-19 vaccination as the spread of the virus continues to pose a threat to South Africa’s citizens, health system, and economic recovery. “The loan forms part of government efforts to reduce debt service costs by making use of cheaper sources of funding through multilateral development banks, whilst supporting the health system to respond to COVID-19 through the roll-out of vaccines, critical research, and treatment measures.” --SABC--
