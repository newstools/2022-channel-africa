The United Kingdom’s Mirror reported on Sunday that the Egyptian striker was set to commit his future to the Merseyside club due to the support he has received after Egypt missed out on World Cup qualification. The player and club had reached an impasse after the initial £220 000($288 000)-a-week which would have made him the club’s highest earner was rejected. Salah wanted a deal that would put him alongside Cristiano Ronaldo as the Premier League’s highest earner on around £500 000 ($655 000)-a-week, but now seems to have a reached a compromise and is willing to accept £400 000($524 000)-a-week. The news that Salah is willing to commit his future to Liverpool will come as music to Manager Jurgen Klopp’s ears as he attempts to guide the club to an unprecedented quadruple. Liverpool, who are in a tight two-horse race with Manchester City for the Premier League title, have already won the Carabao Cup this season, and are competing in the latter stages of the FA Cup and Champions League. --IOL Sport--
