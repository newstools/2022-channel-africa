Roodt says banks are free agencies and at free will to charge customers as they wish. He notes that the South African Reserve Bank is responsible for South African banks for certain minimum requirements that the banks had adhere to. The Efficient Group Economist says the banking system is a competitive market, with exception that the Reserve Bank puts certain requirements in terms of capital adequacy. “The Reserve Bank makes sure that the banks remain viable, but what they charge customers is up to the banks.” Capitec emerged as a new bank, grew to a large bank and is now competing with bigger commercial banks, doing that successfully and competing on pricing. He states that if the banks however over charge, then customers can opt for a different. “This is why Capitec became successful, because people compared charges.” On modernization, Roodt points out that if one wants to be part of the modern economy, they need to be ‘tech-savvy.’ He says with the majority of the bankable people having access to cellphones, latest technology, which evolves with time to benefit people, then makes it easier for them to bank digitally. “Technology has a way of moving people forward. We need to understand it. It has benefits, it is much cheaper, hence the banks ae doing away with branches. They want to operate everything on the internet.”
