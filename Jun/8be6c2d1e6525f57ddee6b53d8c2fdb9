Top economists and business executives met this week at an event themed "The Big Debate" in which the issue of inflation was discussed. Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube says Zimbabwe's inflation is sitting at almost 132%. Doctor Nigel Chanakira, President of the Zimbabwe Economics Society was one of the attendees at "The Big Debate". On the debate to either de-dollarise or re-dollarise, renowned Economist, Tony Hawkins, says the government has failed to ensure sound economic fundamentals. Chanakira argued: “The country will continue to underperform economically without international re-engagements, debt restructuring and access to international capital markets. “The re-engagement looks more distant than ever, especially as the world slides into a new cold war and Zimbabwe is certainly on the wrong side of history. I know some may not agree with me. “Government is not making progress because of the tough global climate and even in rankings, Zimbabwe is always at the bottom”. With inflation topping 131,7%, Hawkins said this was bad for investment. The country’s re-engagement efforts have hit a wall in recent years. Since 2017, when President Emmerson Mnangagwa took office through a military coup that toppled former President, Robert Mugabe, he has been looking at mending relations with the West but in vain. Zimbabwe has been isolated from the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United States following the violent land grabs in 2 000 by war veterans that left a trail of destruction. Several white farmers were killed, while many others were injured during the clashes. --ChannelAfrica/ John Cassim--
