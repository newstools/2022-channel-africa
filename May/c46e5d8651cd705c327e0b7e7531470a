Kristalina Georgieva was speaking at the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. “It feels like an economic precipice for the world energy prices, food costs, interest rates and debts, all on the rise at the same time, is sharply slowing down the global economy. Georgieva said geo politics and war are getting in the way of the normal reaction. “Those public words are echoed privately from top business leaders starting to wonder at the summit of globalisation, whether that process is now going into reverse with unprecedented sanctions, protection strain embargos and genuine fears about a food crisis over shadowing the start of this meeting”. IMF said countries that have very close economic links with Ukraine and Russia are at particular risk of scarcity and supply disruptions and are most affected by the increasing inflows of refugees.  --BBC--
