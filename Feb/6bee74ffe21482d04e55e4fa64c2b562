From crop analysis to medical diagnostics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already used in essential tasks worldwide, but Sefala and a growing number of fellow African developers are pioneering it to tackle their continent's particular challenges. In Africa, AI is gradually making its way into technologies such as advanced surveillance systems and combat drones, which are being deployed to fight organised crime, extremist groups, and violent insurgencies. Though the long-term potential for AI to impact military operations in Africa is undeniable, its impact on organised violence has so far been limited. These limits reflect both the novelty and constraints of existing AI-enabled technology. --AllAfrica--
