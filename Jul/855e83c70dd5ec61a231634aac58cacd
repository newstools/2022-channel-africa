Four years ago, bosses at the now-defunct British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica were apparently caught on camera boasting of the control they had exerted in Kenya's disputed 2017 presidential poll, and their company was accused of mining Kenyans' personal data on Facebook to help President Uhuru Kenyatta win. Facebook now says in a new report that it has pulled down more 37 000 posts for promoting hate speech and 42 000 for violating its violence and incitement policies, in the six months leading up to April 30. The firm also says it has rejected 36 000 political adverts for not complying with its transparency rules. Facebook says it has partnered with independent fact-checkers in Kenya to debunk misinformation ahead of the August polls. Its Director of Public Policy for East and Horn of Africa, Mercy Ndegwa, says they have enhanced controls on their platforms that will make it easy to identify and remove content that could lead to election-related violence. --BBC--
