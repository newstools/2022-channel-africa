The deal includes a $700 million equity investment in Airtel at a price of $9.77 per share and up to $300 million towards implementing commercial agreements, including investments in scaling Airtel's offerings, the companies said. The share issue is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Airtel shares were up 0.54% after the announcement. Google announced plans less than two years ago to infuse $10 billion in India via its digitisation fund over five to seven years through equity deals and tie-ups. Conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd's digital unit Jio Platforms, which houses Airtel's telecom rival Jio, received an investment of $4.5 billion from Google in July 2020. In return, the United States tech behemoth got a seat on Jio's board. --TheEastAfrican--
