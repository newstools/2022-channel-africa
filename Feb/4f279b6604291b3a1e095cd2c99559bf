The WHO-backed tech transfer hub in South Africa was set up in June 2021 to give poorer nations the know-how to produce Covid-19 vaccines, after market leaders of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna, declined a WHO request to share their technology and expertise. Martin Friede, Co-ordinator of the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research, said if companies with approved Covid-19 vaccines or late stage clinical data shared their technology and data with the consortium, the vaccine produced in South Africa could be approved in 12 to 18 months. "It could be 12 months if there was a partnership with a company that already has an approved vaccine. Otherwise, it’s more like 24 to 36 months depending on what the approval process is." The WHO has been trying to persuade Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech to join forces with its African tech transfer hub. Friede said the vaccine will be going into first clinical trials in fourth quarter of this year. --SABC--
