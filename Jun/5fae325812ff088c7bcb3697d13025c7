Uganda says Kenya is now taxing its eggs at a rate of $0.6 a tray, bringing back a levy that had been suspended last December following bilateral talks between Kampala and Nairobi. Ugandan traders have protested the move, saying it does not augur well for trade between the two countries. “The implementation of levies on Ugandan eggs by Kenya is a bad policy and in violation of the East African Community policy of free movement of goods and services originating from the member states,” Godfrey Oundo Ogwabe, the Chairperson Uganda National Cross-Border Trade told the Daily Monitor. The new trade tiff comes at a time when the two countries are yet to resolve a long-standing dispute on milk after Kenya barred Uganda’s dairy products in 2019. Kenya had in the last two years restricted the exports of poultry and dairy products from Uganda, straining the relationship between the two countries. The issue on poultry was resolved after Uganda threatened to ban Nairobi from exporting its goods to the landlocked neighbour. --TheEastAfrican--
