Ministry of Education’s Principal Secretary, Chikondano Mussa, has announced this in a statement yesterday. Mussa said the categories include Sciences Languages, Humanities, Technical and Special Needs Education. She said the number of teachers recruited is over 1 000 and represents the largest recruitment of secondary school teachers by government in the history. “The names of successful teachers have already been sent to all the six Education Division offices where candidates can access the results. “Successful teachers are therefore requested to immediately report to the divisions under which they are appearing for deployment details and start working the week beginning on Monday, March 28, 2022,” she said. According to Mussa, the recruitment and promotion of teachers form part of ongoing efforts by government to improve the quality of education service delivery in the country. She then assured that government will continue reducing the current high Student-Teacher ratio to improve the quality of education across all education subsectors. --Malawi24.com--
