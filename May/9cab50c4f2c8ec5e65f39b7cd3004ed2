The unions are also pushing for a single-year pay deal because they no longer trust the government to honour longer-term accords, according to a presentation they made to the public sector bargaining council. This comes after the government reneged on increases agreed to in 2020, the final year of a three-year deal, on the grounds that it was unaffordable. The remuneration of civil servants accounts for almost a third of total government expenditure and bowing to demands for inflation-beating increases would derail the National Treasury’s plans to rein in the budget deficit and bring runaway state debt under control. Credit-rating companies have repeatedly cited South Africa’s high wage bill as a major risk to State finances. The annual consumer inflation rate is currently 5.9%. When the government backtracked on the 2018 accord, it argued that the Department of Public Service and Administration didn’t have a mandate from the Treasury to sign off on the terms, a view upheld by the nation’s top court. The unions now want written confirmation from the Treasury that it has delegated the necessary negotiating authority to the department. --Moneyweb--
