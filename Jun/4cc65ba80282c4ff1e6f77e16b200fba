The United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office said Glencore had, via its employees and agents, paid bribes of more than $28 million in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea and South Sudan. Sentencing will take place in November. The Swiss-based multinational has already said it expects to pay up to $1.5 billion dollars to settle allegations of bribery.
