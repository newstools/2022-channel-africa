This takes the repurchase rate to 5.5% and the banks' prime lending rate to 9%. The bank has raised the repurchase rate for the fifth successive time since November last year. The Reserve Bank Governor, Lestja Kganyago, says the upside risk to the inflation outlook was pushed up by fuel, food and energy prices, which contributed to the bank's latest decision. "The MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 75 basis points to 5.5% per year with effect from Friday. Three members of the Committee preferred the announced increase, "Kganyago said. "One member preferred a 100 basis point increase. Another member preferred a 50-basis point increase. The revised repurchase rate path remains supportive of credit demand in the near term while raising rates to levels consistent with the current view of inflation risks. " --SABCNews--
