Mogoeng had said on the webinar that he was under an obligation as a Christian to love Israel and pray for peace in Jerusalem. In a statement, Moegoeng says he is apologising because he has been instructed to do so by the Judicial Conduct Committee and he is not above the law. Moegoeng was found guilty of his conduct related to the webinar and was ordered to apologise. He lost a subsequent appeal and was given 10 days to comply with the order of the Judicial Case Conferences. --SABC--
