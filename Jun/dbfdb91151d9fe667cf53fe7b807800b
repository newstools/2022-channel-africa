Morocco and Senegal top a list of some of Africa’s biggest movers on a Global Startup ecosystems ranking, a trend that could significantly boost the visibility of startups in those countries and provide access to investor growth funds. Morocco moved up 16 positions, to 79th slot globally while Senegal climbed 13 positions to 92, debuting in the “top 100 club” of nations hosting startup ecosystems. Senegal’s ranking was buoyed by improved rankings of cities, according to the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2022, an index created by StartupBlink. Mauritius, at 71 is currently the top French-speaking African country on the list. The island nation moved up two positions, thanks to the debut of two of its two cities, Port Louis and Grand Baie in the top 1 000 list of cities. StartupBlink’s Chief Executive Officer, Eli David, said these bigger moves by countries outside the top-ranked countries on the continent is proof of the emergence of seed ecosystems in these countries. “Given the market opportunities and growing startup ecosystems in Francophone countries, startup investment will definitely flow into these countries in the coming years and we are already seeing this happening,” David said. --com/africa--
