Events have been held at his ancestral village of Butiama, where he was laid to rest two decades ago. Some of those who attended described him as a humble man who always frowned on corruption. He is also remembered for his ability to unify Tanzanians from all social and cultural backgrounds, and making Swahili the country’s official language. During the commemorations, Emmanuel Kiondo, Director of Nyerere Museum in Butiama, said they were introducing new elements into the school curriculum so students could learn more about Nyerere. --BBC--
