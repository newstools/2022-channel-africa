President Lazarus Chakwera said he would not shield anyone from prosecution if they got involved in corrupt activities. "Do not accept a gift in exchange for using your office to give someone preferential treatment in the administration of a public service. That is corruption," he said. The President sacked his entire cabinet last week but most of the Ministers were re-appointed in a new line-up announced days later. Anti-government protests have been held since last November to condemn the rising cost of living and allegations of nepotism and corruption. --BBC--
