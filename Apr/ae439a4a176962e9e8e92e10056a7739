"The guide fare set by the Land Transport Regulatory Authority has posed significant challenges for systems like Uber to continue to provide services to our customers," it said in a statement. Uber was launched in Tanzania in 2016. According to the regulatory authority's Director Gilliard Ngewe, Uber was not prepared to comply with its order that ride-hailing companies lower their service fee from 25% to 15%. Ngewe said that operators such as Bolt had complied. --BBC--
