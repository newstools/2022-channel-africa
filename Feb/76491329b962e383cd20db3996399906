The surprise development came in Manhattan Federal Court after a lawyer for the plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, indicated the new deal in a court filing on Monday. Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages last month, failed earlier to get the suit tossed out but the "in principle" settlement is the clearest indication yet that the entire case could be dismissed soon. Court filings do not reveal the size of settlement reached by the parties or whether Prince Andrew admits to any of the accusations against him. In a letter to the judge, Virginia Giuffre's attorney writes that they, along with counsel for the defendant, advise the court that the parties reached a settlement in principle and that they anticipate filing a stipulation of dismissal within 30 days. Guiffre had accused Prince Andrew of raping her while she was a teenager among the victims linked to deceased convicted sex offender and American financier Jeffrey Epstein who died in a New York corrections facility in 2019 from an apparent suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking federal charges. The settlement was reached just weeks ahead of an expected deposition of Queen Elizabeth's third child where the disgraced Prince would have been questioned under oath.  --SABC--
