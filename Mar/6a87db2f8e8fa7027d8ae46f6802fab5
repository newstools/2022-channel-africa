Experts attribute the mental health issue to the current economic hardships, and people losing their loved ones to COVID-19. The increased awareness of mental health problems has also resulted in people presenting at health care facilities to seek help. Johannesburg resident, Tracy Price who suffers from bipolar disorder, shares her journey. The 46-year-old Tracy Prince from Weltevreden Park, west of Johannesburg suffers from Bipolar two disorder. She was diagnosed when she was in her early 20s. She's had six nervous breakdowns and has been hospitalised three times. "Your moods can change within seconds. You can go from a high and you can go right down.  Like on Friday morning I woke up and I was like, I felt kind of numb, I felt quite sad. I did not feel like doing anything and yet on Thursday I was so happy, I was so excited. And you do not know when is going to happen. You can't just snap your fingers and say maybe if I can go see this person, I will feel happier or maybe if I go myself a chocolate, I will feel happier, it does not work like that. You kind of like have to ride it out." In 2019 she quit her corporate job because she could not do it anymore.
