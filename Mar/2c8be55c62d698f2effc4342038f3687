Citing updated data, the National Bureau of Statistics said a total of 6.5 million tons of cement were produced in 2021. This was over and above annual demand in the country, which is estimated at 5.6 million tons, with the surplus being exported to neighbouring countries. Actual production has been rising each year from 3.1 million tons in 2015. Manufacturers say data released by the state agency proves that rising cement prices were not the result of falling production, but rather profiteering by retailers. Tanzania Portland Cement Company Limited Senior Commercial Manager Danford Semwenda said the increase in cement production was largely the result of increased investment. He said the 13 manufacturers operating in Tanzania have an installed capacity of 11 million tons a year, but the 6.5 million tons produced last year were enough to meet domestic demand, with the surplus being exported. “Due to excess supply, we have been able to export nearly 400 000 tons to countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo,” he said. Through the Confederation of Tanzania Industries, cement manufacturers released a statement on February 21, saying they have not increased factory prices despite a rise in the cost of production as a result of rising fuel and transport costs. In 2019, Tanzania cement production increased to 5.29 million tons from 4.54 million tons in 2018, while in 2017 the country had produced 4.39 million tons. In 2016, some 4.05 million tons were produced. --TheCitizen--
