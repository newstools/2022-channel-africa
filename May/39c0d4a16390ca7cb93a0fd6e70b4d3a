The discovery of Okechukwu Okoye's mutilated body over the weekend has sparked outrage. Anambra's State Governor, Charles Soludo, described the killing as gruesome, barbaric and shocking. He announced a reward for information leading to the killers' capture. It's not clear who was behind the attack. Officials have blamed a banned separatist group for increasing violence in the region. The Indigenous People of Biafra, which is campaigning for a breakaway state, has denied involvement in recent attacks. Its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, is standing trial for terrorism and treason-related charges which he has denied. --BBC--
