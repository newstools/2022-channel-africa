In his maiden speech, Fabakary Tombong Jatta called for parliament to be the embodiment of nation-building and a beacon of hope. His appointment as speaker came after Barrow reached a deal with the Jammeh's Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC). Jammeh fled into exile in January 2017 after being defeated by Barrow in elections. Barrow won a second term last year after announcing a pact with the APRC. His National Peoples Party won the highest number of seats in parliamentary elections held last week. Under Gambia's political system, the President can give five parliamentary seats to unelected members, as well as nominating the chamber's speaker, Reuters news agency reports. Jatta, who is the leader of the APRC, expressed his "special gratitude" to the President for nominating him. --BBC--
