The firm also said it will pay more than $1 billion to resolve similar claims with the United States and Brazil. The United Kingdom’s (UK) Serious Fraud Office said it had exposed "profit-driven bribery and corruption" across Glencore Energy UK's oil operations in five African nations. The firm will find how much it must pay in fines at a sentencing in June. Glencore's chairperson said "unacceptable practices" had taken place in relation to the bribery charges it pleaded guilty to at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. The company's agents and employees paid bribes worth over $25 million for preferential access to oil, with approval by the company between 2011 and 2016, the Serious Fraud Office said. The bribes were paid in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and South Sudan, it added. --BBC--  Channel Africa wishes you a happy Africa Day. #WeAllAfrica #MyAfrica
