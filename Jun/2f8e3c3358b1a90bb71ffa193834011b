The military governor of North Kivu province said anyone trading through Bunagana town would be considered a collaborator with the M23 rebel group. The rebels recently seized Bunagana after launching their biggest offensive in a decade. East African leaders have agreed to deploy a regional military force to eastern Congo to counter various rebel groups. The Congolese government has accused Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels.
