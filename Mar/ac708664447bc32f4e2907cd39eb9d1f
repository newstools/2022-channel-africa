The 37-year old running legend failed, however, to break his own world record of 2 hours, 1 minute and 39 seconds set in Berlin in 2018. Last year, Kipchoge also took the Olympic title at the Tokyo Olympics. In the women's race, 28-year old Kenyan Brigid Kosgei, also a world record holder, won in 2 hours, 16 minutes and 2 seconds. She had finished second at the Tokyo Olympics behind her compatriot Perez Jepchirchir. --AfricaNews--
