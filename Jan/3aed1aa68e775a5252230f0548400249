Officials say a pipe burst at the bulk fuel area within the base on Sunday evening. Although foul play has not been ruled out, senior officials say the base is well secured. SANDF Spokesperson, Brigadier-General Andries Mahapa, says “It was just an above-ground pipe that had caught fire. “So at the moment we cannot be in the position to say what the cause was.” He adds: “The Chief Fireman is busy with the investigation so that they can be in the position to give a detailed report on the cause. We are satisfied in terms of the speedy reaction of the fire brigade of the Airforce, we are more than happy. --SABC--
