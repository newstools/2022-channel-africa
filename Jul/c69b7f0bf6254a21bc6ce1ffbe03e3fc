Zambia lost their semi-final 1-0 to South Africa on Monday after Linda Motlhalo converted from 12 yards in the 94th minute. The spot-kick was awarded when Martha Tembo was adjudged to have fouled Jermaine Seoposenwe, and Mwape said the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decision was harsh on his frustrated side. "I'm actually very disappointed with the way the penalty was given," he told BBC Sport Africa. "In the future, people will start saying it will be pointless to have referees if the cameras can decide. "They should just be firm, because it's high time the referees improved in terms of officiating games." Meanwhile, Nigeria Goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie was also critical of the officiating as the Super Falcons had two players sent off, both after the intervention of VAR in their last four defeat on penalties by Morocco. "The officiating was not really okay," she said. Nnadozie also claimed Moroccan fans "did everything to distract" her side, with Nigerian players targeted by laser pens during their shootout. "Since I've been playing football, this is the worst match I've ever played in my life," she added. --BBC--
