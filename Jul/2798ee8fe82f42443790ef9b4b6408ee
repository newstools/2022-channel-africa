Abandoning the series, which forms part of the Super League, hurts South Africa's chances of direct qualification for the 2023 men's ODI World Cup in India with the Proteas currently languishing in 11th spot with 49 points. Cricket South Africa had made a request to Cricket Australia to move the series because CSA plans to host a domestic six team franchise competition at that time and wanted all the nationally contracted Proteas players to be available. The Proteas have effectively forfeited the series, with CSA agreeing that because the matches won't be played before the qualification cut-off date in May, the 30 competition points on offer will be awarded to Australia, pending ICC approval. Proteas ODI and T20 captain Temba Bavuma talks about his batting position in the T20 side and the constant criticism that is often levelled against him. South Africa's remaining Super League matches before the May cut-off date are against ODI world champions England and India, meaning they face an uphill battle to climb out to get out of the bottom five. Those five teams will compete with five associate teams in a qualifying tournament for the final two spots. --IOL--
