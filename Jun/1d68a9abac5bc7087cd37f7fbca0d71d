There has been confusion on whether he will be on the precinct or virtually. One of the issues discussed at Wednesday’s Multi-Party Chief Whip’s Forum was who and how the Presidency’s budget vote will be delivered. Some Chief Whips are relieved that the confusion has been cleared up. Others argue that the President must be physically present in Parliament during the budget vote. However, in an interview with SABC News in Parliament, Presidential Spokesperson Vincent Magwenya confirmed that Ramaphosa will be in Parliament for his budget vote. “Indeed, Ramaphosa will table the Presidency budget vote of the sixth administration from a location that has been allocated by Parliament. “So, that will proceed smoothly from our  expectations, Ramaphosa will be onsite  physically in Parliament tabling the Presidency budget vote speech in an area that has been allocated knowing that  we have limitations and constraints around Parliament, but the President will be there physically in good spirit delivering the presidency budget vote.” Meanwhile, Democratic Alliance Chief Whip Natasha Mazonne says, “I think that the communication that went out was abysmal and whoever the parliamentary officer was that send out that communication should be fired because it caused mass confusion. it made it sound like the Deputy President will be answering the all the questions which we now have been told is not the case. “But I just think that it is polite of the president to come to parliament to participate in his debate especially considering that there is no specific portfolio committee that is dealing with the Presidency. We were told that he will be around so he should be where he belongs.” United Democratic Movement Chief Whip Nqabayomzi Kwankwa also expects Ramaphosa to be in Parliament. --SABC--
