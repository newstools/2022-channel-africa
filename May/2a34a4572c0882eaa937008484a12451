Selamawit Gizew, 24, says she fears for her life and has had to move away from her home after numerous calls from her attacker Yihenew Fenta. A local police inspector Birhanu Admasu however says the attacker has no access to a phone in jail. Selamawit's family says police were not helpful after they reported the acid attack on December 27, 2021, and that it took a month for the family to apprehend the attacker themselves and hand him over to the police. Yihenew is serving a 14-year jail sentence for a charge of grave wilful injury. Selamawit sustained acid burns on her face, neck, chest and back after Yihenew attacked her at a pharmacy where she was working in Keraniyo town, western Ethiopia. She underwent plastic surgery and is recovering well. Selamawit had rejected the advances of her attacker who had been stalking her for years after their first meet up at a local market. --BBC--
