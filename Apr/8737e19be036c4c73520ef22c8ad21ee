The Kenyan national carrier revealed in its report for the year ended December that it did not make any payment for the loans that were taken in two tranches last year and in 2020. Kenya Airways applied for the loans after grounding its fleet following the ban on international flights as Kenya and other nations raced to curb the spread of Covid-19. The carrier received the second batch of $215 million last year. The loans attract an annual interest at the rate of 3% which should be paid by June 20, over five years but the national carrier says it sought a waiver and deferral on the unpaid interest. KQ says the waiver and deferral on the loan helped protect its cash reserves as it struggled to recover from the coronavirus-induced economic meltdown. The loans were meant to foot staff salaries, maintenance of aircraft and water, security and electricity bills in the wake of the Covid-19 disruptions that saw KQ post a $310 million loss, the worst ever in the history of the airline. The government, through the Treasury, holds a 48.9% stake in the airline and has provided KQ tens of millions of dollars’ worth of shareholder loans in recent years. The national carrier turned to operating cargo flights after the government stopped all international flights in mid-March 2020 to slow down the spread of the disease. The airline also furloughed most of its workers and reduced staff salaries by as much as 80% as it sought to reduce costs and protect its already weakened financial position. KQ has also been reducing its staff count in a restructuring plan meant to ease the operations cost of the carrier. --TheEastAfrican--
