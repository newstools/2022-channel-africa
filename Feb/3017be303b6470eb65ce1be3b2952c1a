The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges, resulting in job losses and larger dependency on government social security. Today South Africa (SA) embarks on Census 2022 to count everyone within the borders of the country. The census will kick-off with field workers counting the homeless and people who are away from home, staying in hotels or traveling as well as those in hospitals. Statistician-General at Stats SA, Risenga Maluleke, says the population has grown by almost 3.5 million people whereas the economy has been fluctuating. “Our economy in real terms has gone back to where it was around 2017. “Population growth is not sensitive to shocks, we are yet to see the impact of COVID-19, but the economy which we measure quarterly is sensitive to shocks”, said Maluleke, adding that “shocks can be internal or external”. The transient population will be counted at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg.  --ChannelAfrica/SABC--
