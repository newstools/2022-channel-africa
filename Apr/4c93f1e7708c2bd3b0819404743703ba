The refinery, being built at a cost of $19 billion in Lagos, has 4.74 billion litres storage capacity, Edwin said. He added that 75% of products will be moved by sea within Nigeria.     

“Seventy-five percent hydraulic testing, as well as 70% of electrical cable fitting have been completed preparatory to the completion of the refinery in the fourth quarter of this year,” Edwin said during a site tour with Nigeria’s Information Minister Lai Mohammed. Africa’s richest man, Dangote, said in January he expected his oil refinery project to begin production by the end of the third quarter and reach full capacity by early 2023. The project has been delayed by several years and the cost has shot to $19 billion from Dangote’s earlier estimates of $12 billion to $14 billion. Dangote, who built his fortune in the cement industry, first announced the intention to build a refinery in 2013, with the project expected to be finished in 2016. The billionaire then moved the site to Lekki in Lagos, upgraded the size and said production would start in early 2020. --Moneyweb--
