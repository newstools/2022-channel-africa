The summit will present a unique opportunity to lay the foundations for a renewed and deeper AU-EU partnership with the highest political involvement and based on trust and a clear understanding of mutual interests. Leaders are expected to discuss how both continents can build greater prosperity. The aim is to launch an ambitious Africa-Europe Investment Package, taking into account global challenges such as climate change and the current health crisis. They are also expected to talk about tools and solutions to promote stability and security through a renewed peace and security architecture. A series of thematic roundtables will also be organised tackling topics such as growth financing, health systems and vaccine production, agriculture and sustainable development, education, culture and vocational training, migration and mobility among others. EU and AU heads of state or government will be participating in the roundtables, together with a selected group of external guests who are experts in their respective fields. A joint declaration on a joint vision for 2030 is expected to be adopted by the participants. --Amanda Matshaka/Channel Africa--
