Authorities say the reconstruction of the dam structure at the power plant is due to begin next month. This follows lengthy discussions between the World Bank and Ministry of Finance for such money so as to repair the main hydro power plant in two phases. The Electricity Generation Company (Malawi) Limited (EGENCO) Chief Executive Officer, William Liabunya says in a statement that the works are to start with Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for Phase 1 works. The project of the plant reconstruction at Kapichira is scheduled to happen in two phases. As per regulatory requirements, EGENCO is undertaking an Environmental and Social Management Plan for Phase 1 works. A consultant has been engaged and is on the ground doing the work. It is expected that this activity will be completed by mid-June 2022. The preliminary estimates show that it will take about three to six months to complete the project. EGENCO is hoping that it will get all the necessary support from all key government institutions in the country so that the company can move with speed in the process to identifying competent and experienced consultants and contractors to do the work required to fix the plant. --ChannelAfrica/George Mhango --
