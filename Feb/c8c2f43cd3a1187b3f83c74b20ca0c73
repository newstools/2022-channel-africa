Esperance Luvindao won the Commonwealth Points of Light award for offering 44 000 sessions. "I am beyond thrilled and we are honoured to accept the award! Like I always say, we do not do the work in order to be awarded but to be awarded for doing the work we love is a different kind of blessing," she said. Luvindao is a senior medical doctor from Windhoek. She has done community service and has been outspoken on local media about patient care. Luvindao worked in northern Namibia where her passion to reach out to marginalised communities started. She discovered patients were travelling 50km with a poor transport network to access medical centres. Luvindao also started the "1 Step at A Time" initiative that helped purchase medical equipment for village health practices, reaching thousands of patients in remote areas. --BBC--
