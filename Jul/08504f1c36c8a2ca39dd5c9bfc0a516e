This follows Monday’s arrest of 97 suspected illegal miners in Heidelberg, in the country’s Gauteng province. A national multi-disciplinary team arrested the suspects, Lesotho nationals, between the ages of 18 and 35 as well as an elderly farm owner during a clampdown on illicit mining activities. All the suspects will soon appear in the Heidelberg Magistrate's Court on charges of illegal mining, human trafficking, flouting immigration laws, and illegal possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives. The foundation's Lead Researcher, David van Wyk, says there’s a need to do an audit of the small-scale mines in South Africa. “They need to create conditions within which small-scale mining can operate legally and they need to organise people into co-operatives or some kind of business unit. “They also need to create a central buying agency to buy all the gold so that the illegal miners stop being part of the gold syndicate,” he said. --SABC--
