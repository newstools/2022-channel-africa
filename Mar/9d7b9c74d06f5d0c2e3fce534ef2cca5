"When the court freed us, I received an invitation from Samia. I accepted her invitation and it was a great honour to meet her,"Mbowe told a crowd of his supporters in the central town of Iringa. State prosecutors began their investigation into Mbowe before the death of President John Magufuli last March, but he was arrested and charged in July after Samia had taken over. However, the 60-year-old Chadema leader said Samia had promised him that all Tanzanians would now be treated equally, no matter what their political affiliation. It was a chance for Tanzania to embrace a new approach to politics, he added. The government spokesperson tweeted photos last Friday of Samia meeting Mbowe, saying they had discussed “matters of national interest”. --BBC--
