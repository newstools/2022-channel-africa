The inland waterways authority said the boat had set sail over the weekend later than the rules permitted and that the tide carried the vessel towards a barge, causing it to overturn. The accident came only three days after another passenger boat capsized in the same waters, reportedly drowning two people. Boat accidents are common on Nigerian waterways mainly because of overcrowding and poor maintenance. --BBC--
