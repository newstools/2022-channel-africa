This, according to Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation El Sayyed el Quseir. Quseir said it is important to encourage applied researches to help in facing climate change and its negative impacts on agriculture. Egypt particularly should do so given that it will play host to an important United Nations climate change summit (COP27) this year, added the minister while chairing the board of the Agricultural Research Center on Monday. Quseir underscored the importance of scientific researches in upgrading agricultural guidance services, realizing digital transformation and modernizing irrigation systems, in addition to promoting mechanisms for producing good quality seeds and combating desertification and soil salinity. Chairperson of the center Mohamed Soliman, in turn, reviewed its achievements and efforts in the different spheres covering the flora and fauna nationwide as well as the production of vaccines and serums and organizing veterinary convoys to rural areas.  --EgyptToday--
