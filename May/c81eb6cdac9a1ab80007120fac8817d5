Michael Amushelelo, the Commissar of Economic Development for the Namibia Economic Freedom Fighters (Neff) party, faces multiple charges including incitement to public violence. Some protests were reported on Friday following his arrest. The Namibian Police Chief on Thursday ordered his arrest for allegedly “terrorising” the business community and promoting “hooliganism”. A video shared by The Namibian newspaper showed him ordering some Chinese traders in a shopping centre to close down their premises. The move reportedly paralysed all business operations at the shopping complex. In the video, he claims  without evidence  that the stores were selling “fake things”. The Neff party has close links with the South African Economic Freedom Fighters party founded by firebrand youth opposition leader Julius Malema. --BBC--
