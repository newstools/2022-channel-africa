Different sides have blamed each other for the violence. Amhara officials say the Oromo Liberation rebel group was behind the violence, while Oromo officials blame Amhara militias known as Fano. Neither group has as yet commented. More than 5 000 people were also displaced in the violence that lasted for several days. The violence took place in remote villages in Amhara that neighbour Jille Dhumuga of Oromo zone and Efrata Gidim district of North Shoa zone. --BBC--
