The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) last week forecasted the country could receive heavy rains this week, especially in the Eastern Highlands. Strategic and presidential communications Chief Director in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Anyway Mutambudzi, said people residing in flood-prone regions must take urgent precautionary measures to safeguard against loss of lives and property. "It seems the threat of floods is upon us this coming week, with the heaviest downfalls hitting the Eastern parts of the country around April 21. Those in low lying areas should take precautionary measures," Mutambudzi said. --AllAfrica--
