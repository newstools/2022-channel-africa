President Museveni broke news of the find in his State-of-the-Nation Address but provided little detail, pointing in general that it would fetch the country more than $12 trillion. Technocrats in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Museveni noted, had informed Cabinet that the country was positioned to get slightly under $700 million in royalty payments, with the investors poised to cash in on the windfall. Citing six local gold refineries, among them Africa Gold Refinery in Entebbe that the United States sanctioned in March over illicit source of its gold, the President declared that the time for Uganda to ship unprocessed exports is over. The volume of the reserves is estimated at 31 million tons of gold ore, or net 320 158 tons of gold, valued at $12.8 trillion, according to a document prepared by the line ministry. If the computations are accurate, it would suggest the new gold find would topple the estimated windfall from oil still in the ground in the Albertine region. Uganda’s gold exports have been on the rise since opening the Africa Gold Refinery in Entebbe, according to official records. --TheCitizen--
