The country's Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube has attributed the current slump to rising prices of imported food, fuel and fertilizer. He has also blamed the stronger US Dollar as another factor responsible for weakening of the Zimbabwean currency. But has maintained that the country will continue using both currencies. Ncube said Zimbabwe is one of the most plugged in economies globally. “We are using the US Dollars as a transaction currency locally yet this is a global currency”, he said. Ncube added that any change that happens to the US Dollar globally will directly impact Zimbabwe.  --SABC--
