Last month Pope Francis had to postpone his trip to both countries because of a knee injury, and the Vatican’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, went in his place. "I was impressed that the people in South Sudan were so welcoming," he told the BBC. He added that the country had a "bright future" but said the implementation of the peace agreement was crucial. "The Catholic Church,  especially the Holy See , is always open to intervention, for instance mediation. We offer it in Europe, for instance on the occasion of the war that is going on in Ukraine," he added. "I think also in Africa we are open if the parties to the conflicts are willing to do so." Francis still intends to visit DRC and South Sudan at a later date, and Paolin has called communities in South Sudan to heed the Pope's call to live together "as brothers and sisters". --BBC--
