This follows threats by nursing union, Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) in Gauteng to take action against the provincial government if they do not pay and retain young nurses. Addressing the media in Johannesburg, Denosa condemned what they call the inhumane and heartless conduct meted against nurses by the Gauteng Health Department. Denosa says young nurses have not been paid for close to a quarter of the year. Departmental Head of Communication, Motalatale Modiba says the affected nurses will be paid today. All the Professional Community Service Nurses for the 2021/2022 financial year will be retained and appointed permanently. The process to effect the appointments is underway. On the situation of Post Community Service Nurses and the Community Service Nurses whose salary payment has been outstanding the matter has been resolved. Their salaries will be processed as a matter of urgency upon addressing the related administrative issues,” Modiba said. --ChannelAfrica---
