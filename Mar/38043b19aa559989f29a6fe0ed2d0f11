The governing party reportedly owes the South African Revenue Service(SARS) more than $6 million in taxes, dating back to a number of years. Mabe says the ANC has not received any letter of demand from SARS. Mabe was speaking at media briefing in Johannesburg yesterday following last weekend's National Executive Committee meeting. “This is big fake news doing rounds out there in the public. The ANC engages with SARS from time to time, as a tax collector and they’re having that kind of a relationship. “So those that decide they’re going to speak on behalf of the ANC and SARS when they are neither of the institutions and the media, because these are now running around on social media, deciding to run with this as if it’s news, it’s quite worrying.” According to Mabe the way the media reports on the matter is worrying. --ChannelAfrica--
