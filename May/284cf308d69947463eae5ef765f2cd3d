Just as his beloved Real Madrid came back from the brink to reach the Champions League soccer final on Wednesday, 35-year-old Nadal found extra energy in reserve to win a lengthy tiebreak and secure the 1 050th win of his career. Uncharacteristic errors and double faults from third seed Nadal allowed Goffin to break first and go 3-2 up in the opening set but the Spaniard quickly broke back twice to serve out the set, sealing it with a venomous crosscourt forehand winner. Nadal’s stroke-making became more confident in the second set as he used every corner of the court to pepper winners past Goffin, who had no answer and constantly looked up to the heavens in despair. But the experienced Belgian eventually found his range and played with more authority as he rallied from 3-5 down, breaking twice to force a third set. Playing only his second match after returning from a rib injury, Nadal looked rusty as he let his advantage slip when Goffin saved two match points in the second set, much to the shock of the home fans at the Manolo Santana Stadium. There was nothing to separate the two in the third set that went to an absorbing tiebreak, where Goffin initially bounced back from 4-1 down to nearly clinch victory before Nadal prevailed in just over three hours. --Reuters--
