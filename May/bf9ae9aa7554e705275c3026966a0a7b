Well-wishers danced and sang as James Kagambi left Jomo Kenyatta airport in the capital, Nairobi: Earlier this month, the 62-year-old retired school teacher was part of the first all-black team to climb the world's highest peak. He told BBC Focus on Africa radio he was surprised that the summit was so crowded, but was very happy to have made it to the top at sunrise because "the photos came out right". --BBC--
