Over two days, leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to discuss how best to aid Ukraine, four months into Russia's invasion of the country. The European Commission's proposals for a complete ban on Russian oil imports by the end of this year have been bogged down for the best part of a month. Hungary likened it to dropping a nuclear bomb on its economy. Like some other member-states, Hungary is particularly reliant on the oil pipeline. Various compromises have been discussed, the latest is to target seaborne supplies first and leave pipeline oil until later. Technical talks resume this morning but some diplomats are doubtful there will be a breakthrough in time for the leaders' summit which starts this afternoon.  --BBC--
