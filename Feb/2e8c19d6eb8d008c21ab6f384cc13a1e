Gicheru said he was not guilty of derailing an earlier trial at which Kenya's Deputy President, William Ruto, was accused of fomenting election violence 14 years ago. More than 1 000 people died in the unrest. That case collapsed through lack of evidence, but the ICC declined to acquit the Deputy President of charges of mass murder and persecution. A BBC correspondent says the outcome of Gicheru's case could have ramifications for Ruto as he decides whether to be a presidential candidate for August's election. --BBC--
