This is the first time the President observes the day publicly since the Covid-19 outbreak in the country two years ago. North West Premier, Bushy Maape; Justice and Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola and Sports, Arts and Culture Minister, Nathi Mthethwa are expected to accompany the President. On this day in March 1960, 69 people were killed and 180 wounded in Sharpeville in the Vaal during a protest against the apartheid regime’s pass laws. The venue for this year’s official commemoration is an area bedeviled by high unemployment, a lack of service delivery and rising poverty.
