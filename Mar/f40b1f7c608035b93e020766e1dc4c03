In a statement released on Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry termed accusations by the ambassadors of the United States (US), Britain and Norway on the Wagner's activities in Sudan as "a blatant interference in Sudan's domestic affairs." In March 21, the Troika for Sudan, the US, Britain and Norway said the Wagner Group was engaged in illicit activities that undermine the rule of law in Sudan. Russian private security companies such as Wagner, Patriot, Sewa Security Service and RSB are known to have a presence in Africa. According to Bloomberg, the Wagner Group is engaged in military trainings, as well as in protection of gold mines, in Angola, Libya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. --ChannelAfrica--
