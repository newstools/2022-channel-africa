Earlier, Mali's military government said it was breaking off all defence agreements and cited multiple violations of its sovereignty by French troops and noted a "profound deterioration of the military Co-operation with France for some time now". France said that it "considers that this decision is unjustified and absolutely contests any violation of the bilateral legal framework", AFP quotes a French Spokesperson as saying. France had already been pulling troops out of the country in the wake of two recent coups. "France will continue the withdrawal in good order of its military presence in Mali, in line with the commitments it has made to its partners," the French Spokesperson added. --BBC--
