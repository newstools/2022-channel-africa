It has emerged that the companies supplying NCPB with fertiliser are struggling to strike a balance between supplies to the government and their regular customers. NCPB has confirmed that they are not getting sufficient stocks to meet the farmers' needs with stocks being paid for upfront by farmers before it gets to the depots. The government has set aside $49.2 million for 2 280 000 subsidy bags for farmers growing food crops. As a result, the cereals board is now supplying fertiliser in quotas to benefit all the regions across the country. “We are relying on suppliers’ goodwill to get the stocks that we need to sell to farmers, what we get is what we sell. We do not have control over the number of bags that we get,” said an official at the NCPB. NCPB is selling fertiliser on behalf of the government with the state expected to pay suppliers directly. There have been fears that the suppliers would prefer selling it directly to their customers where they are paid promptly as opposed to NCPB, which could take some time before the payments are made. However, NCPB says they pay the suppliers on time and that should not be a concern. --TheEastAfrican--
