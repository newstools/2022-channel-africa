Former Statistician General, Padi Lehohla, maintains that access to quality education is the only answer for dealing with the high youth unemployment. Others say government needs to liberalise the economy to create conditions for job creation. Research by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) shows that a growing number of young people have been discouraged with the labour market and are also not building on their skills base through education and training. As Stats SA prepares to release the quarterly labour force survey for the first quarter of 2022 today, Lehohla says government's youth employment programmes are not enough to adequately deal with the problem. "A million less among the 15 - 24 were employed in 2020 compared to 2008, 500 000 less were employed in the 25 - 34 level in 2020 compared to 2008”, said Lehlola. “The story is very disturbing, yet the President says we have employed so many among the youth.  The figures don't support that, who gives the President the numbers?”, Lehlola asked.  --SABC--
