The team will pocket a R9.2 million windfall if they win the tournament. South African Football Association President Danny Jordaan says the bonus pool will be shared by the squad of 23. “We are going to pay R9.2 million($580 000) in bonuses for this team on the basis that they win the AFCON, if you look at the other cost in terms of our investment specifically for this AFCON is R10 million($630 000), they can have their calculators and see if they divide it by 23 players.” Each player will receive R400 000($25 000) if they win, R55 000($3 400) if they reach the final, and R40 000($2 500) or R30 000($1 900) for finishing third or fourth. Jordaan says this is the highest ever amount paid to any national team. “This R10 million($630 000) is the highest amount ever paid to any national team, men and women, so you have broken the barriers, the highest amount ever paid to the national team in the history of  SA football. We want you to continue to break barriers in SA football.”
