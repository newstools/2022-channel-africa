It also shows that South Africa along with several other countries, has reached a virtual standstill in efforts to fight corruption. Programme Co-ordinator of the Democracy Development Programme, Brian Mhlongo, says until action is taken against those found guilty of corruption, the country may even regress. Mhlongo says, “It’s quite expected, if you look at the amount of corruption in the public eye in the past ten years. I think institutions’ response to corruption has not been sufficient to warrant that we move up the index. Even the change of presidency back in 2018 as well as some of the reforms that have been instituted that are meant to carry out mechanisms to stop corruption haven’t yielded results that we would like them too.” The CPI, the leading global indicator of public sector corruption, ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). --SABC--
