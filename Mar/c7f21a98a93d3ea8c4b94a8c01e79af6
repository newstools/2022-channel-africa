SAA went bankrupt following several bailouts and was placed on voluntary business rescue in 2019. Last week cabinet announced that the deal had been concluded between the Public Enterprises Department and Takatso. The airline started limited flights again in September last year. Responding to a question from Democratic Alliance’s Member of Parliament Alf Lees, Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane says he will give a detailed report to Scopa. "I commit to responding in writing to you, Chair, through you to the committee on this particular matter around the disposal of the 51% of SAA and the process to date. "I want my answer to be complete in terms of process in terms of when we were approached. In terms of what letters were exchanged between ourselves and Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE), if need be Chair, we will be more than happy and ready to come and appear before you on this matter with DPE." On Saturday SAA interim Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kgokolo said that as the airline regains its momentum, it will be able to create more job opportunities. He confirmed that SAA has released some staff members who were part of a training scheme that has since ended.
