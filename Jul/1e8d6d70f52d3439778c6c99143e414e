The 19-year-old forward has scored two goals in 22 appearances for the Giallorossi since making his first-team debut last October. "Ever since I arrived at this club my aim was to reach the first team," Afena-Gyan told the club website. "Since I did that my life has changed a lot. Now I need to just concentrate on continuing to improve." Afena-Gyan only joined the Italian club at the start of 2021 and progressed rapidly from their Under-18 side to the senior squad under Jose Mourinho. The Roma boss bought the teenager a pair of "very expensive" shoes after he scored his first Serie A goals last November. Afena-Gyan made his Ghana debut in March, helping the Black Stars to qualify for this year's World Cup by overcoming West African rivals Nigeria in a two-legged play-off. He scored his first international goal against Madagascar last month, and has won a total of six caps. --BBC--
