This follows the airline’s announcement late on Tuesday evening that it had suspended operations on all its Kulula.com as well as its British Airways flights due to liquidity constrains. NUMSA said it is confused and shocked that Comair management and its Business Rescue Partners (BRP's) decided to suspend flights this week. The union met with Comair management on Thursday. NUMSA says Comair management has failed to indicate if there will be money available to pay workers’ salaries. NUMSA Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, said under the poor leadership of Orsmond and the BRP's the airline has gone from one crisis to another. “The grounding and suspension of the airline has left thousands of passengers deeply inconvenienced and management handled the situation very poorly. “It is clear that the future of the airline remains very uncertain and we remain doubtful that Orsmond can assist us to find a long lasting resolution”, she said. Hlubi-Majola said they also have questions about the role of the BRP's which have been in charge for almost two years. “They were paid exorbitantly and were seemingly unable to foresee this financial hurdle. Our members will be picketing outside Comair on June 3”, Hlubi-Majola said. --SABC--
