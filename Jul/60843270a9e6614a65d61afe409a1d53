Africa Airlines Association says expensive jet fuel and other expenses involved in running the airlines will weigh down on the profits. International Air Transport Association had earlier warned that rising jet fuel prices were likely to cause airfares to increase this year, as airlines grapple with higher operating costs. The projected loss for this year, however, is lower than what was recorded last year, a pointer that the aviation industry is recovering from massive losses witnessed in the last two years as Covid-19 disrupted the sector. In 2021, African airlines cumulatively lost $8.6 billion in revenues due to the impact of the pandemic, representing 49.8 of 2019 earnings. The Intra-African passenger traffic recovery was estimated at 74% in May due to the easing of anti-Covid-19 restrictions in several African countries. --TheEastAfrican--
