The protesters in Masimba, south-east of Nairobi had on Thursday blocked the main highway connecting the capital to the coastal city of Mombasa for hours. Local county Governor Joseph Ole Lenku said "communities are getting frustrated by the loss of human lives to wildlife" in the area, which borders a national park. "The police should desist from using excessive force when trying to maintain law and order in circumstances like today's, These deaths could have been avoided with a little more understanding," the Governor tweeted. The Kenya Wildlife Service "must keep their animals away from our people to avoid the losses we have witnessed recently". Attacks by wild animals in the area has left several people dead in recent months, local media say. There are unconfirmed reports that the protesters hurled stones at a lorry that was carrying the officers. The local police boss is quoted by Kenyan media as saying that an investigation into the incident was ongoing. The road is crucial for East Africa's economy as it links the port of Mombasa to landlocked countries, such as Uganda, South Sudan and Rwanda. A senator who was driving in the area during the protest said stones were hurled at his vehicle.
