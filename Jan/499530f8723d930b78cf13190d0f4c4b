The SA women were beaten 71-47 by England on Saturday nut produced an improved performance against the world's No 1 netball team on Sunday. SA coach Dorette Badenhorst made a few changes to the team that started on day one of the tournament. During her post match interview against England, the coach admitted that her team did not play well and promised a better display. The Proteas, ranked No 5 in the world, lost the first quarter 14-12 and were only 27-23 down after the second one, before the Australians took control in the final two quarters. "Today we played better, the players played for each other and trusted each other better than they did yesterday," Badenhorst said. "We had a game plan and what I saw today was the team carrying it out. The players that were called up to play really stepped up and I am happy with our performance for today. "It has been particularly important for us to play against some of the best in the world so that we get ready for Commonwealth Games mid-year.” In their next match, the Proteas tackle New Zealand on Tuesday at 19:30 (SA time) --NEWS24--
