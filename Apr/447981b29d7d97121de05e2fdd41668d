Both organisations have for months flagged risks from rising debt levels in emerging markets, particularly as interest rates start to increase to cool accelerating inflation. 

“We see the problem for many countries getting worse and the tools to deal with this problem are disappearing,” Kristalina Georgieva said in an online discussion with World Bank President David Malpass on Tuesday. “The debt problem is knocking on the door louder and louder.” The World Bank estimates that the poorest countries whose fragile economies have been decimated by the pandemic, owe $35 billion in payments in 2022. The urgency to avert what Georgieva has termed “economic collapse” for some countries is growing after the Group of 20 biggest nations’ reprieve on debt-service payments for about 70 struggling nations in place since May 2020 expired at the end of 2021. A plan forged by the G-20 in late 2020 to rework the debt of countries in danger of defaulting known as the Common Framework has been hampered by a lack of coordination, transparency and clarity. “We don’t have the Debt Service Suspension Initiative anymore, the Common Framework has not yet delivered on its promise,” Georgieva said. “If we don’t want to see countries going into debt distress and from there into not servicing debt as Sri Lanka just did, let’s get serious about the Common Framework.” --Moneyweb--
