The cyclone affected 30 645 people and damaged six hospital units. These data refer to the provinces of Nampula and Zambezia, the latter being the most affected. Now that the cyclone has weakened to a tropical depression, it is causing rainfall in the provinces of Nampula, Zambezia, Tete, Niassa, Manica and Sofala, with risks of causing floods. Eight shelters have opened in Nampula, Mozambique’s most populous province which suffered death and destruction when Tropical Storm Ana struck in January. Mozambique was devastated by Cyclone Idai in 2019, the most violent storm to ever hit the country. “Gombe arrived with more intensity than Idai, but luckily it didn’t have the same impact, in terms of destruction and the fact that it lost strength right at the beginning,” said Cesar Tembe from Mozambique’s national institute for risk management. Gombe is now moving towards Malawi, according to Meteo-France. --ChannelAfrica--
