Acting National Consumer Commissioner, Thezi Mabuza, says: “In this case, we are talking about 13 159 vehicles. The models are your ML, your GL and your R class 251 series”, he said. “The concern is about the malfunctioning of the brake booster that would be impaired by advanced corrosion on the housing of your joining points.
