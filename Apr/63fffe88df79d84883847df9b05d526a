South Sudan has given a two-week ultimatum to illegal migrants to register and meet legal requirements to stay and do business in the country. The Director-General of Immigration, Lieutenant General Atem Marol Biar, says 85% of Ugandan nationals who are residing in South Sudan entered the country without legal documents and they have not obtained work permits either. It is not clear what measures migrants who do not register will face. Sources from the Business Union a South Sudanese commerce body revealed that more than one million Ugandans are residing in South Sudan. Most of them are involved in the construction sector as well as in the retail sector, it said. Millions of South Sudanese who fled the conflict in their country are living in Uganda as refugees. In October last year the two countries scrapped visa fees as requirements for their nationals to enter each other’s territory. The move was to foster economic and political integration between the countries which are both in the East Africa Community. --BBC--
