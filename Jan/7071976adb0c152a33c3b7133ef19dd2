A panel, headed by acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, concluded in the first of a three-part report that the State was “captured” during former President Jacob Zuma’s rule, with top government officials and the private sector colluding to loot taxpayer funds. The report was published last week after more than three years of testimony from hundreds of witnesses. Zondo’s panel found the Boston-based company met with Zuma and former Tax Commissioner, Tom Moyane, before it was signed up as a consultant, and it was clear it would be given a contract to revamp the tax agency’s systems prior to the start of the tender process. Pre-emptive appointments were made to “ensure that the necessary pre-planning could be done to redirect the resources of the organisation and assume control,” Zondo said. He recommended that all Bain’s contracts with State entities be re-examined to ensure they were legally compliant and called on law-enforcement agencies to investigate if there were grounds for prosecutors to lay charges in connection with the awarding of any of the deals. --Moneyweb--
