The summit presents a unique opportunity to lay the foundations for a renewed and deeper AU-EU partnership with the highest political involvement and based on trust and a clear understanding of mutual interests. Speaking at the two-day summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said that France's military withdrawal from Mali will take four to six months, during which time there will be fewer operations against Islamist militants in the Sahel. Macron made the statement after the African and Western leaders met to plan how to fight militants in the Sahel region once France and its European allies withdraw troops out of Mali. Speaking on the African continent’s battle to access Covid-19 vaccines, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said vaccines are arriving in numbers but the continent is still calling for trips waiver to enable developing economies to widen access and manufacture their own vaccines. Other matters that will dominate sessions include investments, infrastructure development and Ramaphosa said it's time for former colonizers to give back to the continent. The leaders are also expected to discuss how both continents can build greater prosperity. The aim is to launch an ambitious Africa-Europe Investment Package, taking into account global challenges such as climate change and the current health crisis.  --Amanda Matshaka/ChannelAfrica--
