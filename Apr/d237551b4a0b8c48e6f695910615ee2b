Initiated by the Congolese Ministry of International Cooperation and promotion of public-private partnership, the event will feature a conference and business to government (B to G) meetings. This business meeting aims to serve as a platform for exchange to support investments in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and stimulate investment by Moroccan partners and private companies in projects aimed at consolidating and sustaining the central African country's economic growth. Morocco's economic potential and geostrategic location makes it an African hub in several sectors. In 2020 alone, Morocco exported $27.11 million to DRC, including $9.77 million for electrical, electronic equipment, and $5.18 million for meat, fish, and seafood exports, according to the UN COMTRADE database on international trade. The DRC also aims to increase its investments through public-private partnerships, while focusing on agriculture and tourism - two sectors with high added value for the Moroccan economy. The Casablanca stopover of the Roadshow is the fourth of the Congolese delegation after Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and London. DRC has joined the growing cohort of countries opening diplomatic representations in Morocco’s southern provinces. The Central African country inaugurated its consulate general in Dakhla in December 2020, cementing its traditional support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. As part of the growing cooperation between the two countries, Morocco has decided to increase the number of Moroccan scholarships to Congolese students from 50 to 150. The scholarships intend to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fields of agriculture, fishing, renewable energies, and medicine. The two countries have a long cooperation history in the security field. Morocco’s first participation in a UN-led peacekeeping mission in the DRC was in 1960. As of last year, more than 900 Moroccan Blue Helmets were mobilized in the DRC for peacekeeping operations. --moroccoworldnews.com--
