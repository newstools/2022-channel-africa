At least 150 people were killed in the latest wave of attacks by armed gangs. As the victims were being buried in mass graves, people were still searching for more bodies outside the villages where the attacks took place. Most of the dead were young men and children. Many of them were shot dead as they tried to escape the attacks. The burials took place amidst tears and shock in these rural communities. The raids on at least four villages in Kanam area in Plateau state were some of the worst in Nigeria for many months. The authorities have not given the specific number of people killed. But residents and a traditional ruler have told the BBC more than 150 bodies had been recovered. Dozens of homes were burnt down and hundreds of people displaced. People, mainly women and children, continue to flee to neighbouring towns and villages. Residents have complained that it took the security forces nearly 24 hours to arrive in the villages after the attacks. More security forces have now been deployed. Nigeria is grappling with a wave of violence by armed gangs who frequently carry out killings and kidnappings for ransom, mostly in unprotected rural communities. --BBC--
