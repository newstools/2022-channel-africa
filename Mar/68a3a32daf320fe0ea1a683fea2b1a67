Buhari condemned the killings, describing them as brutal murder by outlaws. The latest violence happened in Kebbi state on Sunday night when gunmen killed members of groups set up to protect villages against attacks by armed gangs. A local official in Takita village in Kebbi State, Umaru Garba, told the BBC the vigilante volunteers were pursuing the gunmen who had just abducted people and stolen cattle. They were then ambushed by the gunmen some of whom had taken positions on trees and in shrubs. They shot dead members of the self-defence vigilante groups. The security forces say they have been bombarding and raiding the armed gangs' forest hideouts. --BBC--
