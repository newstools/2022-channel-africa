Khama, who left Botswana in November 2021, is in South Africa. He previously said he didn't flee the country and was attending to personal matters. He recently spoke to the South African Broadcasting Corporation and opened up about his claims against his country's government. In the interview, he said his family had become the subject of victimisation in Botswana and faced trumped-up charges from a hostile President Mokgweetsi Masisi. When Khama attended the funeral of former Zambian President Rupiah Banda in March, he said in an apparent reference to Masisi that "some politicians are not nice" and added that he was being persecuted in Botswana. Masisi did not attend the Banda funeral. --News24--
