Zambian referee Janny Sikazwe and South Africa’s Victor Gomes have been selected to officiate in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The world-governing body has selected 36 referees, while 69 have been picked as assistant referees, and 24 video referees have been selected ‘based on their quality and performances'. "As always, the criteria we have used is ‘quality first’ and the selected match officials represent the highest level of refereeing worldwide," said the chairperson of the FIFA referees committee, Pierluigi Collina. "The 2018 World Cup was very successful, partly because of the high standard of refereeing, and we will do our best to be even better in a few months in Qatar." Sikazwe, who has been selected to officiate the Caf Confederation Cup match between RS Berkane and Orlando Pirates in Uyo on May 20  got himself in the limelight during the Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Cameroon in a match between Mali and Tunisia. The Zambian blew his whistle to indicate the end of the match in the 85th minute. The match resumed after the error, only for him to end the game again in the 90th minute. However, the match ended after the second blunder, with around 17 seconds of normal time remaining on the clock. Meanwhile, FIFA has also appointed three women referees and three assistants, and Rwanda’s Mukansanga is one of them. "We are very happy that with Stephanie Frappart from France, Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan," Collina added. --www.goal.com--
