Speaking at a WHO committee meeting in Switzerland, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to put in measures like test and treat protocols, improving ventilation and the wearing of masks to curb the high case numbers. "I am concerned that cases of COVID-19 continue to rise, putting further pressure on stretched health systems and health workers," he said. Ghebreyesus said that he was also concerned about the increasing trend of deaths. "New waves of the virus demonstrate again that the COVID-19 is nowhere near over,” Ghebreyesus said. --BBC/Sky News--
