But just when its plans to shift to renewable energy to help drive Africa's most industrialised economy were gaining momentum, rising costs linked to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine threaten further delay. After a six-year hiatus, the country in 2021 held a bidding round for companies to operate wind and solar projects, attracting aggressive offers from more than 100 renewables companies, eager to make up for the shortfalls of State Power generator Eskom. The winners include EDF, Scatec, Engie, and Mainstream Renewable Power. They are among nine companies pledging to supply nearly 4 600 megawatts (MW) of power in the next two years, which would go some way to solving Eskom's problems. Eskom said last week that maintenance and breakdowns had knocked nearly 45% of its total 46 000 MW capacity offline. It says it needs up to 6 000 MW of additional generating capacity. Apart from the unreliability of Eskom's ageing coal power plants, SA is also under pressure to end its reliance on highly-polluting coal as it is the world's 12th biggest emitter of climate-warming gases. At United Nations climate talks last year, Britain, France, Germany, the European Union, and the United States pledged $8.5 billion to help SA make a swifter transition from coal. The problem for the companies that saw opportunity in SA's energy needs is that they agreed to supply power at tariffs so low they stand a minimal chance of making a profit under current conditions. --Reuters--
