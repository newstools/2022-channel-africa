The day will be marked by organisations and countries around the world, including at the United Nations in New York. This year's focus seeks to highlight the vital link between gender equity and climate change with women and girls experiencing the greatest impacts of the climate crisis. This is the largest UN gathering dedicated to women's rights that is being chaired by South Africa for the next two years. Ambassador Mathu Joyini  says” We look at women and their relationship to natural resources. Looking at the ownership of land, into how do support women in that. This is where you start looking at some barriers for women and making sure that they have access and control of land, and you have to change your national policies, legislation to protect women.” --ChannelAfrica--
