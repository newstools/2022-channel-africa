The prices have increased by 17% compared to last month with the capital, Juba, being the most affected. In a statement, the UN also blamed food insecurity for "deepening people’s humanitarian needs” in the country. Some 7.7 million people, more than half of the country’s population, are estimated to be severely food insecure this year. They include 87 000 people who are already facing catastrophic conditions, according to Ocha. On Tuesday, the World Food Programme (WFP) said it was cutting food aid to almost 6.2 million people in South Sudan due to shortages of funds. Among those to be affected by the food cuts are 178 000 school children under WFP's feeding programme. But it says the effect will be across the country, meaning it will have a severe nationwide impact. While global attention is focused on Ukraine, South Sudan continues to grapple with unprecedented levels of food insecurity caused by conflict, climate change, Covid-19 pandemic and the rising cost of living. --BBC--
