Zanzibar's government says it is liaising with the Ukrainian embassy in neighbouring Kenya to evacuate the tourists to Poland. Tourism Minister Leila Mohammed Musa said the safety and well-being of tourists is being looked at. Some hotels where the tourists are staying have reduced their rates, while others are offering free accommodation to guests who have overstayed. Zanzibar's coastal scenery and historical culture is a big draw for foreign tourists. One of the tourists told the BBC that they had been following events in Ukraine from their hotels. They were optimistic of being evacuated nearer home at the earliest opportunity. Ukraine closed its airspace last week citing a high risk to flight safety. --BBC--
