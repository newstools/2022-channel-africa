Sudan said on Tuesday that it had recaptured several of its territories that were being held by the Ethiopian army. The al-Fashaga area is where the north-west of Ethiopia's Amhara region meets Sudan's breadbasket Gedaref state. It has been contested for decades but tensions escalated over the last year with regular skirmishes reported between the two countries. Witnesses have told the BBC that Sudanese forces advanced and retook two settlements that were being occupied by Ethiopians along the disputed area. Military planes could also be seen circling the contested area as the Sudanese assault continued. Pictures on social media showed dozens of Ethiopian military vehicles destroyed, but these could not be immediately verified. Sudan accuses Ethiopian troops of capturing and executing its seven soldiers, but Addis Ababa has denied the allegations and instead accused Sudanese soldiers of encroaching into its territory. The latest skirmishes are a major escalation of tensions between the two eastern African countries who are also embroiled in a dispute over Ethiopia’s filling of a mega hydroelectric dam along the River Nile. --BBC--
