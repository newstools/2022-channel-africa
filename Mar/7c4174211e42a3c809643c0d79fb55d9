Addressing the parliament after taking the oath of office, Fathi Bashagha said he was studying all options to take over in Tripoli. The present Prime Minister there, Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, has said he will not hand over control. Armed groups affiliated with both sides have mobilised in the capital and foreign forces, including from Turkey and Russia, remain entrenched in Libya nearly 18 months after a ceasefire ended the last major bout of warfare. Underlining the tense situation, Bashagha's office has accused Dbeibah of using force to try to stop his cabinet reaching Tobruk for the parliament session by closing air space and seizing three ministers who tried to travel by land. Dbeibah's government has not responded to those claims, though airline sources said domestic flights were not operating and a statement from his defence ministry warned against any armed convoy moving without permission. --Reuters--
