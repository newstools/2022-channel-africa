This has had a significant impact globally and has forced countries, including South Africa, to review their energy needs and strategy. The Southern African Biogas Industry Association estimates that the country’s biogas industry is valued at between $4 billion and $17-billion. Barriers to entry, lack of finance and government red tape have made it much harder for market entrants to make inroads in the sector. South African National Energy Development Institute’s Project Manager of Renewable Energy Dr Karen Surridge says, “Biogas is the smelly gas that is produced when you are around landfills or rotting food, it is basically bacteria that is making methane gas you can equate this to the LPG gas used in cooking heating and lighting.” Experts say lower to middle-income countries have the potential to generate biogas from large amounts of waste. Agricultural waste to municipal and food waste can be transformed into clean and affordable energy, especially in countries that struggle with providing sustainable and reliable electricity supply. --SABC--
