The US Treasury Department, in a statement, said among the targets was the African Gold Refinery in Uganda, which Goetz operates, and several other companies he owns or controls. It accused Goetz and the companies of being involved in illegal gold exports valued at hundreds of millions of dollars per year. In a statement, Goetz said his inclusion on the US sanctions list “seems to be based on misinformation”. He said he has not been to DRC in more than 20 years and has not kept any active contacts within Congo. Goetz said he was asked to set up East Africa’s first gold refinery in 2014, adding that “nothing has made me prouder than to see the impact that African Gold Refinery has had on the gold industry in the Great Lakes region”. The Treasury said a network of armed groups, smugglers and companies generate illicit revenue from the gold industry through forced labour, smuggling or other means. It said the illicit movement of gold provides revenue to armed groups that threaten peace and security in Congo. The Treasury said Goetz’s network sources gold from DRC, Kenya, South Sudan and Tanzania. The Treasury said that since 2016, the African Gold Refinery, considered one of the largest gold refineries in Africa, has sourced illicit gold from mines in regions of Congo that are controlled by armed groups, including the Mai-Mai Yakutumba and Raia Mutomboki militia. Thursday’s move freezes any US assets of those designated and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. --CNBCAfrica--
