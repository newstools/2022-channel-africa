As more than 4,600 people, including 31 patients in Cumbria, wait for a kidney transplant, and with this figure expected to rise, NHS Blood and Transplant is calling on everyone in Cumbria to share their organ donation decision. Anthony Clarkson, Director of Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation, at NHS Blood and Transplant, says: “Sadly patients are facing a longer wait and more people need a kidney transplant, so it is more important than ever for people in Cumbria to share their organ donation decision with their family to help others after their death. "And if anyone in Cumbria is willing to consider living kidney donation, they can find out more on our website. "Please tell your family about your organ donation decision and leave them certain." Kidney transplants have been the hardest hit area of organ transplantation throughout the pandemic, with deceased donor transplants down 22% and living donor transplants down 60%  an overall drop in kidney transplants of 32% in 2020/21, compared to 2019/2020. --nwemail.co.uk--
