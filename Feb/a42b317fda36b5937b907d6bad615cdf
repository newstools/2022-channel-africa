Africa's top-ranked national team, Senegal will find out their opponents in Sunday's final on Thursday, when hosts Cameroon take on Egypt in the second semi. "We dedicate this win to our people," said Senegal coach Aliou Cisse. Senegal's two possible final opponents are the most successful sides in Afcon history with 12 titles between them, while the Lions of Teranga are still searching for their first continental crown, two and a half years after losing to Algeria in the final in Cairo. Senegal's opponents here could not be underestimated. Burkina Faso have shown themselves to be a talented young side and one driven on by the desire to give joy to supporters in a country reeling after President Roch Marc Christian Kabore was overthrown in a military coup last week. That happened to a backdrop of a jihadist insurgency in the landlocked country, and their coach, Kamou Malo, talked of the events giving his team "added motivation". Mane will find out today if he will come up against his Liverpool team-mate, Mohamed Salah and Egypt in the final. --AFP--
