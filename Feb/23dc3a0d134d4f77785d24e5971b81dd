This was just announced in a short statement by Commissioner Dali Mpofu, during a media briefing. The deliberation started at 9am on Saturday morning, following marathon interviews with the four judges tipped for the position. During her interview by the JSC for the position of the country’s top judge, Maya called for government to give women and black lawyers the experience required to become top judges. She reflected on the under-representation of women at all levels of the judiciary and says the quality of future judges is dependent on giving them exposure currently. “We must not stop doing the things we have been doing. In the meantime, agitating for women to get quality work in the professions by the state attorney, that can never be overstated. Government must give black lawyers and women lawyers quality work so that we have a pool when we look for judges and we have people who are ready, who have been exposed to niche areas  like commercial law, when they go to the bench and we do not get these painful comments, that the quality of judgments is being eroded,” she adds. --SABC--
