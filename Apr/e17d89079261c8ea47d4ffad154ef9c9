European football chiefs said Atletico Madrid fans had shown 'discriminatory behaviour' during the first-leg of their quarter-final at Manchester City. Spanish sports daily Marca ran a video last week of Atletico fans making a Nazi salute during the game. UEFA have told Atletico they must close a section of at least 5000 seats and place a '#NoToRacism' banner in the gap. The Spanish champions lost the opener 1-0 on April 5 and host City in Madrid in the second leg on April 13. --AFP--
