The US Dollar’s retreat from two-decade highs has also supported the rand this week. At 0600 GMT, the Rand traded at $1.0 against the Dollar, up 0.27% from its previous close, staying close to two-week highs touched on Thursday. The South African Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee increased the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.75% on Thursday, as it stepped up efforts to fight inflation. Consumer inflation was running at 5.9% in annual terms in March and April, near the top of the central bank’s 3%-6% target range, driven by higher fuel and food prices linked to the war in Ukraine. --Moneyweb--
