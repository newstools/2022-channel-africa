Mali's army said last Friday that it had killed more than 200 Islamist militants during 10 days of fighting in the central Moura region. But the United States, the European Union and the United Nations have called for an independent investigation into reports that hundreds of civilians were killed by government troops and Russian mercenaries known as the Wagner group. Thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed in Mali's 10-year conflict with Islamist militants. --BBC--
