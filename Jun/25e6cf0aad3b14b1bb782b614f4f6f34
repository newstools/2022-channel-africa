Professor Cheryl Cohen on Thursday said this would help the State in tracking the virus and avoiding any fatalities. Yesterday, Health Minster Joe Phaala, announced that South Africa had recorded its first case of Monkeypox. The NICD says contact tracing has commenced in identifying any additional linked cases of Monkeypox in South Africa. The NICD says in a statement the case has been identified through laboratory testing, and involves a 30-year old male from the Gauteng province with no travel history. The institute says the disease is transferable through close human contact including sexual contact. The NICD has indicated that the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to the COVID-19 symptoms, which are flu-like and a disruptive blister-like rash on the skin. It said this virus has a low rate of fatalities and transmissions, however, for government to ensure it doesn't spread out of control, COVID-19 regulations should return. "It is appropriate that the regulations be appealed now because essentially, these control measures and these regulations need to be proportionate to the risk of the disease. And we see that the risk has come down and therefore it is appropriate to relax our control," said Cohen. --ChannelAfrica/EWN--
