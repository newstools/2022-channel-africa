Herdade Lokua and Jospin Mujangi from the city of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, were arrested in November last year outside of Seattle before a federal grand jury indicted them for conspiracy, money laundering, smuggling and legal violations for the trafficking. "In pleading guilty, both defendants admitted that beginning in November 2019, they agreed to smuggle elephant ivory, white rhino horn and pangolin scales to the US," the Justice Department said in a statement. They worked with a middleman to negotiate the sales and coordinate imports to Seattle, the Justice Department said, adding that between August 2020 and September 2020, Lokua and Mujangi shipped three packages containing about 22kg of ivory from Kinshasa. --Reuters--
