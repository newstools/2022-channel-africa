The Commission says it has emerged that there are reports and complaints of large increases in price for seats on the remaining airlines. Comair had its air operator certificate suspended at the weekend following a probe into recent safety incidents. Speaking to Channel Africa, Sipho Ngwema, Spokesperson for South Africa's Competition Commission said airlines are taking advantage of customers. “The prices are exorbitant, it seems as though there are signs here that these prices may be unfair and unreasonable therefore that’s why we want to engage the airlines to say that they cannot take advantage of the situation because at the end of the day the consumer is going to suffer”, said Ngwema. Ngwema said although they understand that airlines operate on the business of demand and supply and demand based pricing, however there are boundaries of reasonable margins. “In terms of demand and supply there must be some reasonable margins and some sense of fairness. This is why as an authority we need to make sure that everything happens within the confines of the competition act”, stressed Ngwema. The commission will be engaging the airlines this week to ensure that prices are stable and stay within the law in terms of being reasonable and fairness. --Khumbelo Mnzhelele/Channel Africa--
