The firm told customers it is using a mixture of lettuce and cabbage after floods destroyed lettuce crops. It comes as shoppers in Australia have been hit with soaring prices for some fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not the first time this year that the company has been hit with shortages of food items. In January, KFC Australia had to modify its menu due to a lack of its key ingredient, chicken. That was caused by a shortage of staff at Australia's biggest chicken supplier, Ingham's, due to the "rapid spread of the Omicron variant across eastern Australian states" at the end of last year. Meanwhile, the world's biggest fast food company McDonald's suffered a shortage of chips in some of its Asian outlets, including those in Japan and Singapore, due to the global supply chain crisis. Like countries around the world, Australia has been hit by food supply chain issues caused by the war in Ukraine and the pandemic.  --BBC--
