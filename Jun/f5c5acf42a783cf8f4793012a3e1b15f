On Monday it emerged that F1 boss Stefano Domenicali has travelled to South Africa to discuss the return of Kyalami to the circuit for the first time since 1993. Many are excited at the prospect of Lewis Hamilton racing in South Africa. While fans will be hoping to catch a glimpse of Hamilton, attending a race in South Africa was the big drawcard. Others backed the choice of Kyalami as the best track. A number of factors will be considered before Kyalami is officially awarded the hosting rights. South Africa was a regular part of the F1 championship until 1985, when some teams and sponsors boycotted the race due to apartheid. With questions around the financial ability of Kyalami to host an F1 race, big corporate investment may be needed. --iol--
