Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, said the new National Salvation Front, comprised of five opposition parties, aims to re-establish democracy in Tunisia. Last July, President Saied sacked the government and suspended parliament. He has since seized control of the judiciary and given himself the power to appoint the Head of the Electoral Commission. Chebbi has called for a "salvation government" to lead the country during a transition period before new elections. --BBC--
