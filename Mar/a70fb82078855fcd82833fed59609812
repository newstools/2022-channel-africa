This is after Kenya's presidential spokesperson, Kanze Dena, had blamed Russia's invasion of Ukraine for the soaring fuel and food prices in that country. In an interview, Dena said the rising cost of living was not exclusive to Kenya. But the embassy blamed the country's rising inflation on sanctions imposed on Russia. "The real cause of the increase in prices in Africa is not Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, but the illegal unilateral “sanctions” imposed by the United States, European Union and their followers on Russia," the embassy wrote on Twitter. --BBC--
