Over 400 people have died as a result of the floods and over 40 000 have been displaced. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric says: "This includes resources and programmes to meet the needs in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces. "Our team is working with partners so that vulnerable communities have access to dignity packs, blankets, food, and other necessities, and is also working to restore access to services and internet connectivity, while ensuring access to health treatments. "Our team is also deploying a specialised group to provide technical assistance to town planning, climate resilience and adaptation and are scheduled to visit the impacted provinces in the coming week to develop a long-term plan for support and assistance, which adds on to support provided three years ago on flooding." --SABC--
