The two dead peacekeepers are Egyptian soldiers.

"This morning, a MINUSMA logistics convoy hit an improvised explosive device north of Mopti (centre). According to a first assessment, the explosion caused the death of two peacekeepers, four others were injured," wrote MINUSMA Spokesperson Olivier Salgado in a tweet. The head of MINUSMA, El-Ghassim Wane, "strongly condemned the attack" in a statement, calling on "Malian authorities to spare no effort to identify the perpetrators of these attacks". The UN Security Council condemned "in the strongest terms" the attack on MINUSMA and extended its deepest sympathies to the families of the Malian soldiers killed. The Malian Armed Forces (FAMA) announced the death of two of their soldiers during fighting in the Gao region (north of the country). The FAMA announced that they had "repelled an attack by Armed Terrorist Groups." The operation was still underway at midday on Monday and the Malian army said in a tweet that nine deaths had been recorded "on the side of the attackers". --AfricaNews--
