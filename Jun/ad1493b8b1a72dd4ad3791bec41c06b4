In a statement, the UN said it was deeply alarmed by reports of the use of live ammunition and tear gas by the security forces in Loliondo district in the north of the country. It said the authorities had decided to turn an area of 1500 sq km into a game reserve, despite an injunction in 2018 by the East African Court of Justice against the move. There had been a lack of transparency and consultation with the Maasai people, it said. --BBC--
