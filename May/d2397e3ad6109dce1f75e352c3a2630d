According to Ethio Telecom, the network will be available on hotspot areas in the capital Addis Ababa, including in the area around Ethio Telecom's Head Office and at the premises of Bole International Airport, before being expanded to cover other parts of the country. “The 5G service is launched in selected places in Addis Ababa,” Ethio Telecom Chief Executive Officer Frehiwot Tamru announced during a launch ceremony. “In the coming 12 months, we will have 150 5G sites in Addis Ababa and in major cities outside the capital.” 5G commercial networks have been launched in key countries such as Botswana, South Africa, Seychelles, Mauritius and Zimbabwe, but the technology remains largely underdeveloped in larger parts of Africa. --TheEastAfrican--
