The deal could have gone a long way in helping the government-owned entity gain financial stability as it struggles with a plethora of court judgments from workers owed salary arrears and provided it with capital to undertake further projects. Hlakoane said Denel had lost out on the deal as it could not secure funds locally and by the time an Egyptian bank offered assistance, the order had been cancelled. “We lost the contract to a French company. “If you snooze you lose. Denel is not like companies in the transport sector that might have a monopoly, in this business we are competing with the best in the world, our integrity has been eroded,” he said. Hlakoane said the reason given by local banks was they would not finance transactions in the defence industry for ethical reasons. Hlakoane said Denel's efforts failed even after it had been granted an extension by the buying entity. “We need to partner with the private sector. They have the connections. We must move away from the reliance on local banks,” he said. The news of the failed deal comes as Business Report questioned Hlakoane on whether Denel stood to gain as the world armed up in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, Hlakoane said Denel was unlikely to secure business from the on-going Russia/Ukraine conflict as European countries tended to monopolise business among themselves. --IOL--
