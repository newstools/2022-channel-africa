The EU took the decision despite acknowledging that Zimbabwe's human rights record had not improved and could worsen. The sanctions were first imposed on the four 20 years ago, but were suspended two years ago. They have now been completely removed. But Sanctions against Zimbabwe's defence industry remain in place. The Zimbabwean government has welcomed the decision. Meanwhile, the EU has renewed sanctions on members of the ruling Zanu PF party and added government's arms manufacturing company, the Zimbabwe Defence Industries. This happened barely 48 hours after President Emmerson Mnangagwa returned from a high-profile summit at the multilateral organisation's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Mnangagwa was in Brussels for the better part of last week, attending a corporative summit between the EU and the African Union.  --AllAfrica/BBC--
