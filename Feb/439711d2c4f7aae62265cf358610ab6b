For the first time, Facebook has also seen no growth in monthly active users. The 18-year-old tech giant, which also faces pressure from platforms like TikTok and Google's YouTube, says it expected slowing revenue growth due to the increased competition. Meta's results from this past quarter compared to the same time last year, the company basically spent almost 40% more on various costs but only increased the revenue by 20%. The company missed investor expectations on daily and monthly active users. Meta says it is being hit by a bunch of different things like privacy changes to Apple's operating systems, higher inflationary costs and supply chain disruptions that impact how much companies spend on advertising on their platforms. --BBC--
