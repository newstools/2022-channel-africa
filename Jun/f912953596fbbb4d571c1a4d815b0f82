The announcement came a day after Raila Odinga's rival, Deputy President William Ruto, picked a former aide turned fierce critic of President Uhuru Kenyatta to be his running mate. Rigathi Gachagua, who served as Kenyatta's personal assistant between 2001 and 2006, was chosen after a secretive, months-long process marked by intense lobbying. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chaired by Wafula Chebukati gave Ruto, the United Democratic Alliance presidential candidate a nod to make his first stab at the top seat over the weekend, while Odinga, who is running on the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party ticket, was given a green light for his fifth stab at the presidency yesterday. Odinga first made his attempt at the presidency in 1997 under the National Development Party (NDP) and in 2007, 2013 and 2017 under the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). In 2013 and 2017, he vied on an ODM ticket under the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy and National Super Alliance (Nasa) coalitions respectively. Other candidates cleared to run for President are Professor George Wajackoyah of Roots Party, Walter Mong’are of Umoja Summit Party and lawyer David Mwaura Waihiga of the Agano party. Just after getting the IEBC nod over the weekend, Ruto hit the campaign trail with his first rally at the historic Kamukunji grounds in Nairobi while Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua yesterday took to Undugu grounds in Lang’ata Constituency to launch their official campaigns before heading to Nakuru County. --nation.africa--
