Dispelling speculation that secret talks were already under way with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), Abiy said his government had instituted a committee to examine the possibility of holding negotiations. "It is not so simple to conduct negotiations. There is a lot of work to be done (before) and a committee has been set up" to look into the issue, Abiy told Ethiopian MPs. The committee will be headed by Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonen, who also serves as foreign minister, and will draft a report detailing the preconditions for negotiations, he said. The comments follow the government's declaration of an "indefinite humanitarian truce" in March, paving the way for humanitarian aid to reach the northernmost region of Tigray for the first time since mid-December. The conflict has driven hundreds of thousands of people to the brink of famine, displaced more than two million and left more than nine million in need of food aid, according to the United Nations. "Peace isn't something you hide," Abiy told lawmakers in response to rumoured talks with the rebels. "We are saying we want peace; doesn't mean we are going to do secret negotiations. Secret negotiations have no substance," he added.
