The protests have been viewed as an attempt to subvert the democratically-established power. This week's riots in Luanda, also saw the destruction of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola party headquarters, a bus of the Ministry of Health set on fire, several roads cut with burning tyres and other materials, as well as saw about 40 young taxi drivers arrested. In reaction, the Angola Head of State said what happened on Monday was “a real act of terror, whose fingerprints left on the crime scene are clearly visible". In a message to the nation, the President said the country was the target of "an act of rebellion that altered public order, vandalized public and private property and put at risk the safety and lives of peaceful citizens," including health professionals and the media. The President's statement came on the same day that the Luanda court acquitted 11 of the 33 taxi drivers arrested and accused by the police and public prosecutor of rioting due to insufficient evidence. Only six were sentenced to a month in jail converted into a fine for preventing other taxi drivers from carrying out taxi activities. Thus, so far, none of the detainees is guilty of acts of terror as accused by the President due to lack of evidence according to the taxi drivers' lawyer. Other detainees will be brought to court on Thursday. --ChannelAfrica/Jacob Tivane--
