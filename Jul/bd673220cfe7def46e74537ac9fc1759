The Opposition Movements Alliance says the country has "become ungovernable" and is "at the brink of disintegrating" during the tenure of the current unity government. In a statement, the coalition accused President Salva Kiir's government of failing to fully implement a peace agreement signed in 2018. 

The government has not yet commented on their statement. The development comes a week after the United States announced it was ending its assistance for monitoring the peace process due to the country's failure to meet specified milestones. --BBC--
