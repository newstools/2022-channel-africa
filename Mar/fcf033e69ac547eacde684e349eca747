The company also launched its first solarised service station at the Total Energies Samora service station in the city in an effort to give users an opportunity to enjoy products and services powered by solar energy. The company introduced its Total Energies image in Tanzania in May 2021 in its ambitious plan to become a world–class player in the energy transition. The new name and new visual identity of Total Energies embodies the company as a broad energy player that is committed to producing and providing more affordable, reliable and clean energies to as many people as possible. Speaking during the event, the Total Energies Marketing Tanzania Ltd Managing Director, Jean-Francois Schoepp, said the ongoing transformation plan was in line with the firm’s wider goal of cutting carbon emission. “It is with great honour and pride that we are here today to reveal our milestone and ambition as the first Oil Marketing Company in Tanzania to have solarized service stations which is in line with our climate ambition to have net zero carbon emission and a reflection of our transition from Total Tanzania Ltd to Total Energies Marketing Tanzania Ltd,” he said. He said so far, the company has set up 24 solarised stations in the country. It has an ambitious target to solarise up to 68 service stations by the end of 2022 as well as its industrial sites such as its Dar es Salaam terminal and its Lubricants Oil Blending Plant.  --TheCitizen--
