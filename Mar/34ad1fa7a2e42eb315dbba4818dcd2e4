This growth comes on the back of a 6.4% contraction in 2020. Stats SA says the positive economic growth in 2021 was led by “higher economic activity in finance which contributed 0.9% point based on growth of 3.7%; personal services which contributed 0.8% of point based on growth of 5.3%; and manufacturing which contributed 0.8% of a based on growth of 6.6%”. Independent economist Dawie Roodt agrees, adding: “Quite easily we could have pushed it gross domestic product (GDP ) above 5%. Not by much, perhaps 5.1% or 5.2% or so.” “The real bad thing about the unrest is the impact of that will be felt for many years to come because every year is going to be a little lower now than what it would have been because of the unrest that we have seen in the last year.” Investec Chief Economist Annabel Bishop takes things a step further: “If we hadn’t had that severe negative impact of the riots in July, we wouldn’t have had that depressing impact on business confidence, businesses’ activity and of course the ability to expand even in the quarter. “We would have seen the GDP growth comes out well above 5% for 2021. In fact, GDP growth could have come out at 6%,” says Bishop. --Moneyweb--
