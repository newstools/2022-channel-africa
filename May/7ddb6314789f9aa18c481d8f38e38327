However, here in South Africa, the voices of labour aren’t celebrated. They complain that the gains made by ordinary workers since independence are fast going backwards and there’s self-introspection going on about the need for the workers’ movement to be more united than it currently is. A serious discussion is raging about the depoliticisation of unions, with some calling for the breakup of the tripartite alliance of the African National Congress, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, and the South African Communist Party.

General Secretary of the South African Federation of Trade Unions, Zwelinzima Vavi says workers are under siege.
