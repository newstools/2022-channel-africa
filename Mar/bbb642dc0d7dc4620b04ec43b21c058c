The UN fact-finding mission said that repression and intimidation of activists, lawyers and journalists seems to have risen since presidential elections were postponed in December, putting UN-backed moves towards greater stability in renewed jeopardy. It also found that people responsible for the abuses were not prosecuted but merely moved to other posts. The mission’s ongoing investigation covers reports of human rights violations inside several prisons that were declared closed yet reportedly still operate in secret and secret prison networks allegedly controlled by different armed militias. The Mission has also found that authorities failed to implement orders to release detainees in numerous instances. In its report of October 2021, the Fact-Finding Mission concluded that acts of murder, torture, imprisonment, rape and enforced disappearance perpetrated in Libya’s prisons may amount to crimes against humanity. “We have uncovered further evidence that the human rights violations experienced by detainees in Libya are widespread, systematic or both,” stated Mohamed Auajjar, the Chairperson of the Fact-Finding Mission. The Mission’s latest investigations coincide with further political turmoil in Libya, notably the final lead-up to and aftermath of the postponement of elections scheduled for December 2021. In the report, the experts explain that this has directed their fact-finding efforts towards violations, abuses and crimes that can especially hamper the transition to the rule of law and democratic elections. --SABC/UN--
