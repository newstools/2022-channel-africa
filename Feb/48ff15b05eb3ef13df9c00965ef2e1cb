President Emmanuel Macron has asked to reorganise French troops in the Sahel region. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the country would continue to fight against terrorism in neighbouring countries. France had already cut the number of troops in Mali. Mali's military took power in 2020 and there has been growing tension between the rulers and international partners. In December, 16 countries mostly in Europe condemned Mali's decision to work with private military contractors from the Russian Wagner group. --BBC--
