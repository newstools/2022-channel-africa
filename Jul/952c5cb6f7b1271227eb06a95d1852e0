DRC, a leading miner of copper, cobalt, gold and diamonds, has long aimed to boost its oil sector and is believed to have sizeable reserves. 
Output has remained flat for years at about 25 000 barrels per day because of underinvestment. Environmental groups and activists have expressed alarm at the plans as many of the concessions overlap national parks. The DRC has in the past defended its right to drill for oil in national parks. The blocks to be put up for auction on July 28 include three in the coastal basin of Kongo Central province, nine in the Cuvette Centrale, 11 near Lake Tanganyika and four near Lake Albert. The three gas blocks are on Lake Kivu. --Reuters--
