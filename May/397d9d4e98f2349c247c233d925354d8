The Ethiopian government said that rebellious Tigrayan forces are still in the neighbouring region of Afar, despite a spokesperson for the Tigrayan forces announcing their withdrawal days earlier.  

“We now urge the parties, to seize the opportunity to advance a negotiated ceasefire, including the necessary security arrangements, and call for the restoration of essential services in Tigray on an urgent basis,” he said in a statement. Government spokesperson Legesse Tulu told state media that the news that Tigrayan forces had left Afar were “big lies.” Afar Police Commissioner Ahmed Harif told Reuters that Tigrayan forces were still in four districts bordering Tigray Koneba, Abala, Berhale and Magale had not moved since Monday.      

Getachew Reda, the spokesperson for the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the party that controls Tigray, did not respond to requests for comment. On Monday, he told Reuters Tigrayan forces were leaving Afar.
