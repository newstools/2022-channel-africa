Zambia secured their qualification on away goals following a 1-1 draw against Namibia, while Senegal went through 3-2 on penalties after a 1-0 defeat in Mali. Senegal had beaten their West African rivals 1-0 in last week's first leg, but Agueissa Diarra's 14th-minute goal in Bamako meant the game went to spot kicks. Senegal's women will now appear at the Nations Cup finals for the first time since 2012, and have a chance to emulate the men's side after the Teranga Lions won their first-ever continental title earlier this month. The second leg of Zambia's play-off, played in South Africa with Namibia as the designated home side, saw both teams approach the match in an attacking manner after a goalless draw in the first leg last Wednesday. Zambia and Senegal become the fourth and fifth sides to book their spots at the finals after hosts Morocco, Uganda and Burundi, who secured their place with a 11-1 aggregate win over Djibouti on Monday. The final seven qualifying ties will be decided on Wednesday. Morocco will host the Women's Nations Cup from 2-23 July, with the four semi-finalists automatically qualifying for the 2023 Women's World Cup. --BBC--
