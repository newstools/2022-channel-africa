According to a 2021 poll commissioned by South Consulting, said although around half of Kenyans have confidence in the electoral commission to support a free and fair election, around half also believe that the government's favoured candidate will win, no matter how people vote. Previously, a national opinion poll conducted by Afro-barometer in 2019 showed that only 29.2% of Kenyans thought that the country's 2017 election was free and fair. Another 33.5% thought that there were minor problems, 12% that there were major problems, and 21.7% that the elections were not free and fair at all. --AllAfrica--
