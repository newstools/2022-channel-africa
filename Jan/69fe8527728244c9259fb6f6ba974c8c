It comes a week after some military officers toppled the government of elected President Roch Kaboré. The Ecowas ministerial-level mission will be joined by a United Nations (UN) delegation led by the head of the UN's office for West Africa and the Sahel, Mahamat Saleh Annadif. The joint team will hold talks with the Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Damiba-led junta, as well as various Burkinabè actors. An in-person Ecowas summit is planned for Thursday in Ghana for further deliberations on the situation. Leaders of the regional body held a virtual emergency meeting on Friday where they suspended the country’s membership from the regional bloc. There appears to be a troubling resurgence of coups in West Africa, with Burkina Faso being the third country after Mali and Guinea. --BBC--
