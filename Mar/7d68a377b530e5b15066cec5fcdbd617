The awards are aimed at honouring young leaders involved in sports, business and community development. The award ceremony was held in Accra in Ghana. Malahlela was nominated for establishing a football club that develops soccer skills amongst the youth. He says winning the award will serve as a motivation to the people of Limpopo and South Africa. “Winning the 40 under 40 award for Africa in sports is really humbling experience. Me as a person and the people of Limpopo province and Turfloop, it really augers well for ambitions of being in the professional ranks in the coming season,” says Nakedi Malahlela. --SABC--
