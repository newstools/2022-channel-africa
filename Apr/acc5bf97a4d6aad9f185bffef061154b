The provincial Premier, Sihle Zikalala, said that almost 41 000 people had been affected around the city of Durban. Days of torrential rain washed away homes, roads and bridges, prompting the government to declare a state of disaster on Wednesday. Electricity and water has been restored to some areas, but authorities are urging patience with relief teams stretched to capacity. President Cyril Ramaphosa has blamed climate change for the disaster. --BBC--
