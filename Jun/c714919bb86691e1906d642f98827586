The central bank of Africa’s second-largest gold and cocoa producer hiked its main interest rate in March and again last month to try to stem runaway inflation, but it is yet to halt the rise in prices. The Cedi currency has been under pressure, losing around 5% against the Dollar since its May 9 close and more than 21% since the start of the year, as analysts warn of a looming debt crisis. May inflation was driven higher by categories such as food, transport and housing, with prices of imported goods rising more than domestically produced ones for the second month in a row, the statistics agency said. Food prices were up 30.1% in annual terms in May, with oils and fats, water and cereal products seeing the largest increases this year. Around one-fifth of Ghana’s cereals come from Russia, which is fighting a war in Ukraine that has sent prices for global commodities like wheat and oil soaring. Transport, which includes fuel, registered price growth of 39.0% while housing, which includes water, electricity and gas, saw a 32.3% increase. --Reuters--
