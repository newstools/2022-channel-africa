This follows the conclusion of the debate and approval of the bill at the Kenyan National Assembly in a Wednesday January 05, 22 sitting that went late into the night The Political Parties Amendment Bill 2021, seeks to anchor in law, coalitions as political parties with proponents saying it is aimed at instilling party discipline. Kenyatta supporters and his erstwhile opponent Raila Odinga side became victorious after the proposals submitted by the leader government business Amos Kimunya were approved by parliament. According to Kimunya the bill will be submitted to the senate which will discuss it and approve it before it can be presented to the president who will sign and become law before next month. Kenyans have reacted saying that the national parliament has been turned into a field of fight between political parties during the discussion on the bill for political parties and political coalitions while some members saying the changes were necessary in avoiding post-election violence with other noting that MPs are only interested in safeguarding their political interests. It is understood that violence also was witnessed when parliamentarians supporting Deputy President William Ruto were trying to prevent the leader of government business Amos Kimunya from presenting the bill. The victory of the President's supporters in parliament on Wednesday means that MPs supporting his Deputy President William Ruto failed to get enough number to bring any revolution to both parliamentarians. Sources indicated that similar confrontation between the two sides is expected again as the bill will be presented in the senate parliament next week.  --ChannelAfrica--
