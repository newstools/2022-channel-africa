Some 50 000 people are reportedly displaced following the fighting that first erupted on June 6 and has been ongoing between the Gimir tribe and the Arab Rizeigat tribe in the Kulbus area, 160km northeast of El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the dead included more than 100 from Gimir and 25 from the Rizeigat, adding that the clashes also resulted in the injury of more than 130 others, mostly Gimirs. The UN said that at least 25 villages in the Kulbus area were attacked, burnt and looted. The body count came as the United States Embassy in Khartoum on Tuesday called on authorities to protect civilians and to hold accountable those responsible for the violence. The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and head of Unitams, Volker Peretz, said he is “once again appalled by the violence in Kulbus, West Darfur, which resulted in a high number of casualties.” He also called on the authorities, tribal leaders and armed organisations to de-escalate. The clashes arose from a dispute over land ownership, which the Arab Rizeigat tribe says began after members of the Gimir community attacked a Rizeigat farmer while he ploughed. Usually, most disputes in Darfur are over property rights and grazing lands between pastoralists and farmers. Sudan's western Darfur region was ravaged by a bitter civil war that erupted in 2003. In 2020, Sudan signed a peace deal with key rebel groups including those from Darfur. The main conflict has subsided over the years, but the region remains awash with weapons and deadly clashes often erupt over access to pasture or water. --TheEastAfrican--
