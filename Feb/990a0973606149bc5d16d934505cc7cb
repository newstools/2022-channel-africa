United States (US) officials have warned that Moscow could launch an attack on Ukraine after amassing more than 100 000 troops close to its neighbour's border, with the West preparing heavy sanctions.

Aviators are concerned about the impact on their dealings with Russian companies.

Sanctions could disrupt payments to leasing firms, and any retaliatory move by Moscow to restrict access to Russian airspace might throw east-west trade into chaos. "We are expecting an asymmetrical Russian response," said a Western source involved in drawing up scenarios, adding the West was unlikely to restrict its own airspace first.

Air corridors between parts of Europe or North America and Asia stretch across Russia, making its 26 million square km (10 million square miles) of airspace a vital trade intersection.

Without access to Russia's airways, experts say airlines face having to divert flights south while avoiding areas of tension in the Middle East, adding significant cost at a time when airlines are reeling from the pandemic.
