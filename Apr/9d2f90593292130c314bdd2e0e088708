He says the only information he received related to protests by truck drivers, members of the Mkhonto Wesizwe Military Veterans Association and those who were aggrieved by the impending incarceration of former President Jacob Zuma. Ramaphosa was testifying at the hearings of the South African Human Rights Commission's investigation into the July 2021 unrest in parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. Former State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo testified at the hearings that she gave 14 alerts to the police prior to last year's riots about threats to the country's security. But she said she was unable to meet with the President to give him the information. Ramaphosa says the substance of the information he received never alluded to the riots as they unfolded. "I am yet to see such a report that says this is what we knew, this is how it will unfold. I have not seen such a report myself because it would have said these are the planners, this is what they plan to attack, they will be moving from this mall to that mall and all that. Now, that was not forthcoming."  --SABCNews--
