There were no patients or staff casualties from the fire that affected temporary structures at Steve Biko Hospital, the South African government said in a statement. The fire was later put out. The government said that 18 patients and one body had to be moved to other areas of the hospital as a safety precaution. The cause of the fire is unknown and an investigation is under way. The fire is the third such incident in a hospital since last year. Nearly 700 patients were evacuated in April last year from Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Johannesburg following a blaze, prompting the hospital to be closed for a week. --BBC--
