In a televised address on Thursday, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered that the cost of the staple food be halved from 205 Shillings (S1.73). The government is still working out how it will compensate retailers who had purchased expensive stock before the price announcement was made, spokesperson Cyrus Oguna told the BBC. Many have questioned how all vendors will be informed, how much they'll be compensated, and how it will all be enforced. Some shop owners have not adopted the price changes for fear of losing income. --BBC--
