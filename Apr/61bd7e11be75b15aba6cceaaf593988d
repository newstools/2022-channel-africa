The park is home to the indigenous Batwa population. They are descendants of the original rainforest inhabitants and today a disadvantaged and impoverished minority. About 6 000 people were expelled from their land in 1976, six years after the park was established. There have been repeated conflicts since. Villagers have said that the attackers were park rangers and DRC soldiers. Chief Mbuwa Kalimba Bachirembera is convinced that the park administration wants to drive the Batwa people out of the park, although it includes their ancestral land.
