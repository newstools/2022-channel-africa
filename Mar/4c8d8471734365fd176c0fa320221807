Since January, the number of people assisted by WFP has tripled to an estimated 865 000. The armed conflict in Cabo Delgado province has forced people out of their areas of residence and production, leaving over 800 000 people dependent on food. The WFP is the Government's main partner in food assistance. In addition to the 865 000 people displaced by terrorism, there are the victims of natural disasters in Nampula and Zambezia, who also need food assistance. --Milton Maluleque/Channel Africa--
