Lourenço arrived on Sunday in Cape Verde, starting this morning the official programme of the state visit in Praia, with the reception at the Presidential Palace by the Cape Verdean President, José Maria Neves, who last January made his first visit abroad, after being sworn into office in November, precisely to Luanda. At the end of the morning, Lourenço will travel to the Government Palace to attend, along with Cape Verde's Prime Minister, Ulisses Correia e Silva, the signing of the final documents of the 8th Joint Commission for Cooperation between Cape Verde and Angola, which met again on Saturday in Praia, after 14 years. One of those documents is the agreement involving Angolan airline TAAG, which will provide a Boeing 737-700 aircraft on a leasing basis to its Cape Verdean counterpart, TACV. "It is a first step that we are taking with TACV, we do not exclude the integration of other countries, even in the regional context or even in the context of Portuguese-speaking African Countries, but here begins a new stage of our bilateral relationship and with another level of effectiveness," Angolan Transport Minister Ricardo Abreu announced on Saturday after the meeting of the mixed commission. He added that state airline TAAG would be leasing one of its "new generation" Boeing 737-700s to allow TACV to re-launch its routes it only operates international flights, after the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, with the two companies implementing a "marriage" that also involves operating the air hubs of Sal Cape Verde and Luanda. According to information from TAAG, the Angolan airline operates several Boeing 737s with capacity for 120 passengers, essentially on domestic routes, which it is replacing with six Dash 8-400 turboprops. --ChannelAfrica--
