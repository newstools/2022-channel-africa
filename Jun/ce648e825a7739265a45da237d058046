It is the latest escalation in the row between the two nations, which have a decades-long history of fraught ties and have recently seen sporadic clashes on their shared border. Kinshasa accuses Kigali of backing the rebels. Rwanda denies DRC’s allegations that it has sent troops into eastern DRC or that it supports the M23 rebels, whose leadership hails from the same Tutsi ethnic group as Rwanda President Paul Kagame. Meanwhile, East African Heads of State have called for an immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities between DRC and the several rebel groups fighting in its eastern region. At a meeting in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, the leaders also directed that rebel groups relinquish all territory they hold, and that peace negotiations be intensified. Regional army Chiefs also briefed the Presidents on operational procedures and rules of engagement for an East African military force, which is soon to be deployed to DRC's restive North Kivu and Ituri provinces.  --Bloomberg--
