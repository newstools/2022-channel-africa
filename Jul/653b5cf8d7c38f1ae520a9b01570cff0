In a statement, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) says employees of Smartmatic International BV were arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi on arrival from Venezuela. It termed their detention “without justification” as an “exhibition of intimidation on hardworking persons who are only keen to deliver a robust technology infrastructure”. The Commission says it is surprising that this happened despite notifying security authorities that the three were in the country lawfully. IEBC Chairperson, Wafula Chebukati, says the trio's continued detention could affect election preparedness since technology will play a key role in the August 9 polls. He demanded their immediate release. Kenya Police Spokesperson, Bruno Shioso, confirmed later in a statement that they had arrested a foreigner carrying election-related material. He says the arrest was “necessitated by the sensitivity” of the materials. The police also alleged that election stickers that were seized had not been declared “as per the law”, nor accompanied by an IEBC official. Shioso said the police released the detained person after subsequent investigations revealed that the materials belonged to IEBC and handed them to the commission. --BBC--
