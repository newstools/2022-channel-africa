Seven South Africans have been murdered in the area since October last year, allegedly by a gang using the same modus operandi. Last week, Police Minister Bheki Cele, together with Makhura, Gauteng Safety Member of Executive Counsel, Faith Mazibuko and newly-appointed National Police Commissioner, General Fannie Masemola, met with community leaders to calm tensions in Diepsloot. Last, week a Zimbabwean national was killed. Government has since deployed 100 police officers to the township as well as immigration officials. Community leader Andrew Maleka said: “There are some issues that were raised in the meeting relating to Alvin and others, especially at Extension 1, and those are the issues that Makhura is expected to come and address.” There are also reports of discrimination where people are being asked for documentation. The Diepsloot Community Policing Forum says a long-term sustainable solution is needed to fight crime in the area. --SABC--
