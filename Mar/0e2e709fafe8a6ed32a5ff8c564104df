Banda passed away in Lusaka on Friday night at the age of 85 after a two-year illness. Banda served as Zambian President between 2008 and 2011. He also served as a senior diplomat in several posts under first President Kenneth Kaunda before being appointed as Vice-President in 2006 by then President Levy Mwanawasa. Ramaphosa says both South Africans and Zambians are united in mourning. Banda was born in the town of Miko, Gwanda, Southern Rhodesia now Zimbabwe; his parents had come from Northern Rhodesia to find employment prior to his birth, and he was sponsored by a local Dutch Reformed Church preacher and later, the family of B. R. Naik, a family of Indian origin, to continue his education into adulthood. Banda became involved in politics when he joined the youth wing of the UNIP in 1960. He is one of the notable alumni of Rusangu University, Zambia. He is expected to be buried this Friday, March 18. --SABC--
