At least four communities were targeted by attackers on motorbikes last Sunday, killing more than 150 people and burning down dozens of homes. A Member of Parliament (MP) from the region, Yusuf Adamu Gagdi, told the BBC the displaced people had fled to other towns and villages. On Tuesday MPs urged President Muhammadu Buhari to send more security forces to the area as well as to establish permanent military bases there. Nigeria is struggling to cope with a wave of violence by armed gangs, that carry out killings and kidnappings for ransom, mostly in unprotected rural communities. --BBC--
