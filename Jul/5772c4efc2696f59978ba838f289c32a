Ruto told the BBC that he was running as his own man in the 9 August poll and aims to solve the country’s problems, including the high cost of living and corruption "It is [President Kenyatta] who made a commitment to himself and to the people of Kenya. That he would support me, "said Ruto. "But I'm also a person who understands that he’s an adult and he can change his mind. I can't fault him. " Ruto also defended how he has characterised his campaign as being for hustlers. "I have grown my career from nothing. And I have climbed the ranks and learned the hard way to where I am today. I believe that I present an opportunity for other people with the same background like me, and there are millions that are the majority, "he said. On corruption, Ruto said he would address endemic graft within his first days in office. "We want a situation where even if the President is corrupt, he should be taken to court like in other countries. No-one is above the law," said Ruto. --BBC--
