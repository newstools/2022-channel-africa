By recalling a bond, a firm pays off the principal amount and the interest of a debt instrument before the due or maturity date. This occurs where the issuer intends to clear the debt from its books and save on the regular interest payments. The telco, a subsidiary of India’s Bharti Airtel Ltd, which has operations in 14 African countries, redeemed the bonds that were to mature in March 2023 saving $26 million on interest payments from the early redemption. “In line with our strategy to continue to reduce foreign currency debt at holding company, we also repaid $505 million bonds in March 2022, a year earlier than their March 2023 redemption date,” the company says in its financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022. Following the early repayment of the bonds priced at 5.125%, the Group now has only $1 billion of bonds remaining at Holding Company level that are due in May 2024. In 2019, the telco raised $750 million through an initial public offering and used the net proceeds from the issue of new shares to retire part of the $4 billion debt. “Over this period the Group has reduced its debt by $1.7 billion and improved its leverage ratio to 1.3x net debt to underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation at March 31, 2022”, the statement said. The Group completed the sale of more than 2600 telecommunication towers in Tanzania, Madagascar and Malawi generating total proceeds of $284 million which were used to partly reduce its debt to $2.9 billion from $3.5 billion. The Group recorded a gain of $111 million from the tower sales but the loss of tower sharing revenue as a result of the sale of these towers amounted to $29 million per annum. The Group which has 128.4 million customers is looking to sell more shares to the public through an IPO in three years and sell more telecommunication towers in Chad and Gabon. In March 2021, the Group announced memorandum of understanding arrangements with Helios Towers for the potential sale of its tower assets in Chad and Gabon. In February 2022, Airtel Africa announced it had agreed an extension to their memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Helios Towers in Gabon, with completion still subject to Helios Towers obtaining a passive infrastructure licence. The MoU relating to tower assets in Chad expired February 2022, and Airtel Africa and Helios Towers mutually agreed that this would not be renewed. The Group’s net profit for the year increased by 82% to $755 million from $415 million last year. --TheEastAfrican--
