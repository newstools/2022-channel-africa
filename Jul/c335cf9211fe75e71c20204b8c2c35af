This is one career that has always been a preserve of women for decades, but young men are now venturing and excelling. These youngsters say they are earning a living better than certain men’s jobs that are very hard. Weston Jomaya is a young Harare based hairdresser who is making headlines for his skills. Normally hairdressing is regarded as a career for women but due to job scarcity, men are also penetrating the market. In Harare such young men who are now plaiting women’s hair can be found at several spots and are now a favourite as they are regarded as very professional. Several women who spoke to Channel Africa said they hurt talking several hours or even half a day having their hair done. It's because male hairdressers are fast and focused, they now prefer male hairdressers. The more the customers the more the money Weston told Channel Africa as he plaited his customer in Harare. That was Weston as he described how his work is done but he added his rates are a bit low in the high-density areas. He can still make more money when he visits his customers in the upmarket suburbs. Although these young men who have penetrated the female job market have been well accepted including Weston who started years ago, other men perceive them as gay. Homosexuality is illegal and taboo in Zimbabwe hence Weston and his colleagues are often segregated in society. Rachell, a Harare woman, spoke highly of male hairdressers owing to the skill and professionalism. She said they don’t have time for rumour mongering and insulting while working compared to their counterparts, hence her preference for male hairdressers. --Zimbabwean Correspondent John Cassim in Harare--
