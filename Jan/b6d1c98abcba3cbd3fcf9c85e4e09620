Chakwera says the regional bloc’s standby force will continue working with the Mozambican Defence Force in rooting out terrorism and insurgents in the northern region of Cabo Delgado. He made the comments during the closing ceremony of SADC Heads of States Summit in Lilongwe, on Wednesday. The Summit resolved to extend the mission which was expiring this week for another six months. The Malawi President says the SADC Mission in Mozambique (SAMIM) must stay the course and see that peace and stability is returned to the region of Cabo Delgado: “Our approach to this mission must continue to be multi-dimensional and comprehensive. It must not only focus on neutralizing the threat but also have a post conflict plan to rebuild.” The political will to improve on the ground operations is seemingly there but will it translate to a better resourced mission. The Summit noted the challenges SAMIM faces in relation to lack of funding and the unavailability of equipment including aircraft. Member states agreed that they would find the money needed to make the 1 000 strong mission a success. --SABC--
