Dos Santos presided over a Marxist-oriented one-party state until the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War led to the MPLA and Unita signing a peace accord. It saw Dos Santos and Unita's Jonas Savimbi face off against each other in the first multi-party elections in Angola since independence. Dos Santos defeated Savimbi by a narrow margin, resulting in a second round being called, but Savimbi boycotted it, choosing to take up arms again. Just over a decade later, in February 2002, Dos Santos's troops killed Savimbi and a peace deal was later negotiated with the new Unita leadership. "Not one more shot, we have to preserve the people alive and negotiate peace," Dos Santos said at the time, when he was about to formally declare the end of the war. Thus, a new country was born. Reconstruction and reconciliation were Dos Santos's main goals. At the time, he enjoyed considerable popularity, as demonstrated by the victory of the MPLA in the 2008 elections with 82% of the vote.
