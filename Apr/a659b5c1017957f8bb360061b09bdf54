Some 30 EV models will be launched by 2030 with production volume of more than two million vehicles a year, Japan’s second-biggest automaker said in a statement Tuesday. EVs will make up around 40% of the company’s fleet by the end of the decade, Honda said. 

Honda declared in June of last year it would phase out sales of gasoline-powered cars completely by 2040, becoming Japan’s first automaker to publicly say so. In the months since, newly minted Chief Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe has pushed to hasten the Tokyo-based company’s drive into the increasingly competitive electric segment. Today, Honda has “clear plans in place” with regard to electrification and making its EV business profitable, CEO Mibe said in a briefing Tuesday. “We are moving steadily forward in line with those plans.” Last month, Honda issued $2.75 billion of green bonds that it intends to use to fund development and production of EVs and fuel-cell cars. 

Honda said on Tuesday it will consider issuing more of the securities to fund its electrification spending, though it will have to look further into specifics around budget and timing.
