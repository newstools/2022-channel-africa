Unbeaten in their capital since 1988, the result means Cameroon will remain in stronghold Yaounde for their last-16 tie against a third-placed side from Group C, D or E on Monday, January 24. Cape Verde finished third in the group on four points, behind Burkina Faso in the table on head-to-head record, and the Blue Sharks face a wait to see if they will progress as one of four best third-placed sides. At the last Nations Cup, four points was good enough to reach the last 16, just as it was for teams at both the 2016 and 2020 European Championships. With Cape Verde drawing 1-1 and knowing a point might take them through, their fans must have feared the worst after goalkeeper Vozinha spilled a cross into the path of the tournament's top scorer only for Aboubakar to flash the ball over the crossbar from ten yards out. It was a finish that belied the striker's fine form, after the 29-year-old had earlier equalled a national record set by Cameroon legend, and now national FA President, Samuel Eto'o. The top scorer in Nations Cup history with 18 goals, Eto'o scored five goals in both the 2006 and 2008 tournaments a record that is looking in danger with four matches possibly left for the five-time champions to play. --BBC--
