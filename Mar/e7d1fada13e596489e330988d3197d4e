This comes after health authorities in the southern African nation declared an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 last month, after a case was detected in a young child in the capital Lilongwe. UNICEF has described the resurgence of the wild poliovirus in Malawi, decades after it was last detected as cause for serious concern. The first vaccine shipment is expected to arrive in the country ahead of the first immunisation campaign which is scheduled to begin in the coming weeks. UNICEF is also installing 223 new vaccine refrigerators, repairing 51 vaccine refrigerators and distributing 200 vaccine carriers and 38 cold boxes to health centres across the country in preparation for this mass vaccination exercise. Health authorities have activated surveillance measures in Malawi and neighbouring countries to detect any other potential cases. As an epidemic-prone, highly contagious disease, polio can spread easily through the movement of people from endemic to polio-free areas.
