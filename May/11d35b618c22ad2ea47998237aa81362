The Google Impact Report, which Google announced its launch, is conducted by Public First research agency that looks at how Google products (Search, Play, Maps, YouTube and Google Ads) help people, local businesses, content creators and developers in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Around the world, Google releases Impact Reports which are based on public polling, economic modelling and third party data. The Google Impact Report in Egypt explores the impact of Google products in 2021 across three areas: People, Businesses and Economy. According to the findings of the report, the Android developer ecosystem supports at least 85 000 jobs in Egypt every year. It added that YouTube channels making six figures or more in revenue are up by 55% year over year and that the total number of developers making $10 000 per month on Google Play grew by 22%.  --EgyptToday--
