Four other officials from the Tzaneen Home Affairs office in the Limpopo province have been suspended and are due to appear before a disciplinary hearing soon for allegedly processing fraudulent documents. The Department is cracking down on those who manufacture and sell fake South African identity documents and passports. In a response to a written parliamentary question from IFP's Liezl van der Merwe, Minister of Home Affairs Aaron Motsoaledi said fake IDs and passports were noticed both locally and internationally. Motsoaledi said once fake documents are spotted the department's civic services branch refers the matter to the counter-corruption branch. If department officials are involved security services branch investigates and the immigration services' inspectorate division deals with matters relating to foreign nationals. Motsoaledi said other cases are referred to the police and law enforcement. --SABC--
