Speaking after a top United Kingdom Minister said Ukrainian strikes on Russian targets were legitimate, she warned that the West should take Moscow's vows to respond to strikes on its territory seriously. Her comments come after Russia reported multiple blasts and an ammunition depot fire yesterday in the country's south, the latest in a spate of incidents described by a top Ukrainian official as "karma." As we reported earlier this morning, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that it was fair for Ukraine to strike Russian targets in self-defence. "If Ukraine did choose to target the logistics structure of the Russian army, that would be legitimate under international law," Wallace said. Earlier this week another UK Minister said it would be legitimate for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons on Russian soil. --BBC--
