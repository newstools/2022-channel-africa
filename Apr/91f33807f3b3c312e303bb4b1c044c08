The junta, which seized power in 2020, has developed closer ties with Russia after a series of disagreements with France. The former colonial power began withdrawing its troops from the West African nation last month after almost 10 years fighting the jihadist threat. About 75% of French troops are reported to have departed. Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group are now believed to be helping Mali’s military, though the junta has refused to confirm their deployment. France’s Foreign Minister said in an interview with France24 that Mali’s military leaders had become "hostage" to the mercenaries from Wagner. Jean-Yves le Drian accused Wagner of being engaged in human rights abuses and preying on Mali’s resources. But Mali’s Defence Minister Col Sadio Camara batted away such criticism, saying the equipment from Russia gave the army the autonomy it needed to battle insurgents. --BBC--
