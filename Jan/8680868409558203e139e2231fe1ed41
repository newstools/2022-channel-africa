The Director General of the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, Gilbert Kibe, said the ban was lifted on Monday night. Kenya had suspended all passenger flights from the UAE on  January 10. It was reciprocating UAE's ban on all passenger flights from Kenya over allegations that some Kenyan travellers had tested positive for Covid on arrival in Dubai yet they had certificates indicating that they did not have the virus. The ban however did not affect cargo flights. The UAE is yet to lift its ban on Kenyan flights. --BBC--
