There is no official figure for the death toll attacks but some reports suggest it could be more than 100. The Prime Minister is often criticised for failing to deal with the worsening insecurity across Ethiopia. There’s been an unprecedented surge in communal violence and ethnic conflicts since he came to power four years ago. Now Abiy says his administration has "zero tolerance" for the killings of civilians. The most recent incident was in western Oromia, the country’s largest region. Witnesses told the BBC people were buried in mass graves and houses were set ablaze when members of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) launched attacks on villages inhabited by minority ethnic Amharas. The group denies carrying out the attacks and blames the government instead. Fighting between the government and the OLA has been reported in western Oromia prompting concerns that civilians could be caught in the crossfire. --BBC--
