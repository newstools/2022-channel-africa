According to reports, during his State of the Nation Address, Chakwera vowed to confront all forms of lawless conduct by public officials. “Three ministers are facing charges of abuse of office with the minister of lands having been arrested last month in a bribery case. “The Labour Minister has been accused of diverting COVID-19 funds while his energy counterpart has been blamed for meddling with fuel deals,” the report added.
