The authorities said Malanji was arrested for owning a hotel suspected to be bought by proceeds of crime. He is also suspected to have procured a helicopter $700 000 from proceeds of crime. Malanji has previously denied the allegations. He was arrested by the anti-money laundering unit of Zambia’s Drug Enforcement Commission, becoming the second former Minister to be arrested in a week after former Justice Minister Given Lubinda who was charged on Tuesday. “The hotel has since been seized together with the two helicopters, the other one being the helicopter he was arrested for earlier which are currently in South Africa and arrangements are being made to have them brought into the country,” the commission's spokesperson Mathias Kamanga said in a statement. Malanji has been released on police bond, according to the local Diamond Television. He served in the cabinet of former President Edgar Lungu, who lost the presidential election in August 2021. Zambia’s new government is pursuing an anti-corruption drive after winning elections last year. It is yet to secure any major convictions. --BBC--
