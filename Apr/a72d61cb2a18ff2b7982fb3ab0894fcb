The new information is from a stakeholder report presented by ACSA Chief Executive Officer, Mpumi Mpofu, on Monday. The domestic segment currently accounts for 83% of ACSA's total traffic in the current financial year.  “Pre-Covid-19 this segment accounted for 70% of total traffic. “Regional airports saw a faster recovery, largely due to traffic at these airports being driven by leisure and 'visiting friends and family' traffic," states the report. On the other hand, the meetings, events and other business travel segments have been impacted the most due to reduced travel budgets and the rapid development of virtual meeting and conferencing platforms. The events and business travel segments, including government travel,  accounted for over 50% of the traffic at ACSA's three international airports (Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban) before the pandemic. --News24--
