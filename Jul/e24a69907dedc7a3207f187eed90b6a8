Banks offer junk-rated loans to companies with limited cash flow when they are confident, they can sell them to investors as a way to recycle capital. The primary buyers are collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), funds which have struggled of late to raise capital because of a pullback by one of their biggest investors, banks. Banks have traditionally snapped up highly rated bonds from CLOs, which use sale proceeds to buy junk-rated, or leveraged, loans from banks. Market sources said that bank demand has cooled in the last few months because higher interest rates have made the bond returns less attractive than more highly rated assets such as United States Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds. This is weighing on new CLO offerings. The bottleneck happened as central banks rapidly raised interest rates to fight inflation, leading banks to reduce lending to companies with weak balance sheets. The impact ranges widely across the financial system, investors and bankers said. "The core buyers of investment grade CLO liabilities have been impacted by interest rate moves and global financial market volatility, reducing their capacity to make new investments in CLO debt," said Doug Paolillo, Head of Investment Firm Sixth Street Partners’ CLO business. Banks also have been struggling to sell leveraged loans because buyers are seeking more favorable terms. Many of the loans banks are selling were priced before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the rapid central bank rate hikes that have fueled concerns about an economic slowdown.  --Reuters--
