The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that more than two-thirds of the population in the region require humanitarian assistance. It says 8.3 million people, including refugees, are expected to face severe acute hunger this year. WFP says most of the refugees it helps in east Africa, have already had their rations cut by up to 50%. In parts of west Africa, including Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, and Mali, the amount of food being given out has also dropped significantly, as prices rise. It says part of the problem is the war in Ukraine, which is normally a major supplier of wheat, maize, and sunflower oil. In several African countries, conflict is forcing people to flee the rural areas, where they would normally be farming, and head for safety in towns and cities.  --SABC--
