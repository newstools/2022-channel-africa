The announcement was made in a statement that did not offer any reasons for the dismissal of the ministers or give indications of when the positions would be filled. It is the second major reorganisation of the cabinet in recent months. Others sacked included the Ministers of Mineral Resources and Energy, Fisheries, Inland Waters and Fisheries and Public Works, Housing and Water Resources. Political observers in the country said they were not surprised by the sackings. In November, Nyusi sacked and replaced the Ministers of Defence and Interior. --BBC--
