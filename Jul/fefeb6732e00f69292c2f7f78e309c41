Banyana  booked their spot for next year's FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand with a 1-0 win over Tunisia in the quarter-final match last night at the Africa Women's Cup of Nations. Jermaine Seoposenwe scored the solitary goal in the 14th minute. Seoposwenwe says while they have achieved their main objective of qualifying for the World Cup, there are aspects of their game that were not satisfactory. Banyana, who managed to protect the solitary goal for almost 70 minutes, will return to the drawing board with some aspects of the game especially on attack that needs special attention. While celebrations continue, Banyana Banyana will immediately regroup and prepare to face Zambia in the semi-finals to keep their hopes of winning the tournament alive. --SABC--
