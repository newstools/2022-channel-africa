Delivering the inaugural Kenneth Kaunda memorial lecture in Lusaka, Zambia, last night, Mbeki says Kaunda accommodated all liberation struggle activists in Zambia. Kaunda led Zambia to independence in 1964 and served as that country's President until 1991. He passed away last year in June at the age of 97. Further, Mbeki says the late Zambian founding father left an indelible mark in the fight against apartheid and colonialism. The former South African President says it is important for Africans to help in each other at times of need.
