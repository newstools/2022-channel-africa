According to Agri South Africa, several farmers may be put out of business due to operating costs caused by the increase. Both grades of petrol increased by $0.95 per litre. Diesel will see a hike of up to $0.97 cents per litre. Chief Executive Officer of Agri SA, Christo van der Rheede, says the Ukraine-Russia conflict is also a cause for concern. “We fear that we will see a number of farmers that will not be able to make it. “South Africa has some of the harshest conditions to practise farming in and we need greater support especially from government”, said van der Rheede. “We have the resources to produce our own fertiliser. We have the resources to produce our own petroleum, we've seem farmers doing that for many years”. “We don't want a situation where people suffer as a result of hunger, then at the end of the day we get social upheaval because of hunger in the country”, he concluded.  --SABC--
