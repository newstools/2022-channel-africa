South Africa, renowned for its stunning vistas, wildlife, wineries and culture is now at Level 3. In total, the CDC moved up four destinations to the "high" risk column on Monday. The CDC recently overhauled its ratings system for assessing Covid-19 risk for travellers. The Level 3 "high" risk category is now the top rung in terms of risk level. Level 2 is considered "moderate" risk, and Level 1 is "low" risk. Level 4, previously the highest risk category, is now reserved only for special circumstances, such as extremely high case counts, emergence of a new variant of concern or health care infrastructure collapse. Under the new system, no destinations have been placed at Level 4 so far. Lesotho, a mountainous landlocked nation within South Africa, moved up from Level 1 on Monday. All the other places had been at Level 2. Last week, only one new destination was placed in Level 3: the British Virgin Islands. Overall, the past four weeks of advisories have seen little in the way of the dramatic shifts in status that characterized this past winter and early spring during the original Omicron variant surge. In the CDC's new system, the "Level 3: Covid-19 High" category applies to countries that have had more than 100 cases per 100 000 residents in the past 28 days. Much of Europe has been stubbornly lodged there with the summer travel season getting ever closer. As of May 16, the following popular European destinations were among those remaining at Level 3. --CNN--
