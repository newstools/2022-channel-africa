This observation was made by Namibian Deputy Minister of Energy, Kornelia Shilunga, in a speech read on her behalf during the opening of the Regional Energy Regulators Association (RERA) of Southern Africa's annual general meeting. Shilunga said there is a serious need for commitment to speed up the transition to cost-reflective tariffs or to devise alternative funding mechanisms to mitigate against electricity shortages and prevent a full-blown crisis in the long run in the region. The region is experiencing massive financial gaps in investments needed for building new generation, transmission and distribution capacities. Also speaking at the opening, Chairperson of RERA Henry Kachaje said the organisation as a subsidiary has a duty to address regional energy challenges such as the limited access to clean and versatile sources of energy, diminished surplus generation capacity as well as constrained transmission capacity. "It is against this backdrop that RERA chose 'Enhancing Electricity Access and Performance' as the theme for this year. We remain fully committed to working with member states, stakeholders and cooperating partners in addressing the various challenges that are stifling the development and competitiveness of the energy industry in the region," Kachaje noted. According to him, RERA is committed as an association to the mission of facilitating the harmonisation of regulatory policies, legislation, standards and practices, and to be a platform for effective cooperation among energy regulators within the SADC region. --AllAfrica--
