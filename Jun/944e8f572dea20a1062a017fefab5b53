McIlroy is coming off a victory at the RBC Canadian Open. It was the Northern Irishman’s first successful title defense on the PGA Tour and launched him to No. 3 in the Official World Golf Ranking the highest he has been since after the 2020 PGA Championship. It was a breakthrough after several months of quality golf that saw McIlroy post four top-10 results in his past five starts and six in 11 worldwide starts this season. McIlroy, who won the US Open in 2011, is seeking his first major title since the 2014 PGA Championship. He is the +1000 favorite to win this week at Draft Kings and is being offered at +1100 by Bet MGM. The short odds have led to relatively modest action on McIlroy, however. He is fourth at Draft Kings with 6.8% of the winning handle. That’s behind Jordan Spieth (+2800), who has drawn 9.0% of the handle, Will Zalatoris (7.6 % at +3000) and Sam Burns (6.9% at +3000). World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler has been the most popular wager at Bet MGM, where he has been backed by 6.6% of the total bets and 9.4% of the handle as his odds have shortened to +1400. That far out-paces Zalatoris, who has been supported by 5.4 and 4.1% of the action, respectively, at+2500. Scheffler is the biggest current liability at Bet MGM. Next is Collin Morikawa, who opened at +2200 but is now +2800 with 5.0% of the bets and 7.3 % of the handle backing him. Third is Australia’s Cameron Smith, who has drawn 6.2% of the handle as his odds have shortened from +5000 to+2200. Justin Thomas, who finished four shots behind McIlroy in Canada, has the second-shortest odds at both sports books as he is +1100 at Draft Kings and+1200 at Bet MGM. He has drawn 5.2% of the bets and 4.7% of the handle at Draft Kings and 4.5 and 5.7%, respectively, at Bet MGM. Reigning US Open champion Jon Rahm enters the week ranked second in the world and with a victory earlier this year in Mexico. He’s being offered at+1200 at Draft Kings and +1400 at Bet MGM, where he opened as the +1000 favourite. --Reuters--
