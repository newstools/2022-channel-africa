Ader, who is in the company of first lady Anita Herczent, was received at the Jomo Kenyatta International airport by Defence Cabinet Secretary, Rachael Omamo. State House Spokesperson, Kanze Dena, says Kenya is excited for the State visit, given the warm and strong bilateral ties dating back to 1964 when Hungary established an Embasy in Nairobi. The Hungarian President, while in Kenya, will also meet the Speaker of the National Assembly, Justin Muturi. He will further visit development projects in that country.  --ChannelAfrica--
