Wydad celebrated a third continental crown after triumphs in 1992 and 2017 as they denied Ahly a record third straight title after El Moutaraji scored his first with a thunderous long-range strike and grabbed a second from close range. The goals sent the home fans into raptures, with the final controversially staged at Wydad’s stadium after the Confederation of African Football said Morocco was the only bidder, Senegal having withdrawn their application. Ahly failed in a bid to have the match postponed and moved to a neutral territory after their appeal to the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport was turned down last week. Ahly’s loss is more disappointment for Egyptian football in 2022 after the country were beaten by Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations final in Cameroon and then lost to the same team in the playoffs for a place at this year’s World Cup in Qatar. Wydad gave an early warning to the visitors when striker Guy Mbenza struck the bar with a powerful shot from the edge of the box. They then took the lead after 15 minutes as El Moutaraji picked up the ball 30 metres from goal and unleashed a superb strike into the top corner that gave Ahly goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy no chance.
