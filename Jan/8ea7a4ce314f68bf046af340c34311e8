Déby, who heads Chad’s Transitional Military Council, said that a delegation from Chad was currently in Doha to meet Qatari officials to prepare for the reconciliation talks. Déby, who sometimes tweets in Arabic, spoke to Al Jazeera Arabic TV's dedicated interview programme, Liqaa Khas, in French. His remarks were dubbed over in Arabic. The Chadian leader said he hoped the talks would lead to an agreement on disarming rebel groups, some of which are based in neighbouring Libya. --BBC--
