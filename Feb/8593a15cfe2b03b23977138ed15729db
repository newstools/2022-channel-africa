The attack by unknown gunmen was not on government buildings however, but rather the offices of a private radio station. Capital Radio's equipment, including its transmitter, mixing console and computers  were destroyed. The station is an affiliate of the United States international broadcaster, Voice of America, but it is not clear who carried out the attack or why. The same radio station was previously targeted in July 2020. After hearing the gunshots, some civil servants were seen fleeing home. At least 11 people were killed last Tuesday when soldiers attempted to overthrow President Umaro Sissoco Embaló, according to the authorities. The President has announced an inquiry into the attempted coup. --BBC--
