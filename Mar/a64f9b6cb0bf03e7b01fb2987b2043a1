Chamisa said this while addressing thousands of supporters, ahead of this coming weekend's by-elections. The opposition accuses the ruling Zanu-PF party of rigging previous elections and with Chamisa insisting that won the 2018 vote only to be cheated out of taking over power by the President Emmerson Mnangagwa-led regime. Chamisa challenged the election outcome at the Constitutional Court but the petition was dismissed for lack of evidence. --AllAfrica--
