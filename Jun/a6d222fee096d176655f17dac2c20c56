On Tuesday the new President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, visited Baidoa, in the worst affected region. His Special Envoy for Drought and Humanitarian Affairs, Abdirahman Abdishakur Warsame, told the BBC that people were desperate for help and he had seen children in critical need. He said Somalia had hardly received any assistance from the international community and he was concerned that the drought could develop into a famine. The United Nations has warned that the Horn of Africa is suffering from its worst drought in 40 years, following four consecutive poor rainfall seasons. --BBC--
