Despite the floods and the peak rainy season expected in January, February and March, the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) says the situation is under control. INGD Spokesperson, Paulo Tomás, said that the rain is already flooding the places previously indicated. In Maputo City, there are rivers that have already started to overflow and the result is the blocking of access roads, thus complicating the lives of the population. By the end of the 2021-2022 rainy seasons, the authorities estimate that over a million people could be affected across the country, so they are calling for the abandonment of risk areas. -- Milton Maluleque-ChannelAfrica--
