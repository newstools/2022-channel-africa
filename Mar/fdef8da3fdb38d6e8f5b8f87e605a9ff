He was speaking at the official opening of the Fourth SA Investment Conference currently under way at the Sandton Convention Centre, north of Johannesburg. The one-day meeting is called to help attract the R1,2 trillion worth of investment by the end of 2023. Ramaphosa said with at least $52 billion already pledged since the inaugural conference in 2018, government is two thirds away from reaching its target. He says there are many reasons to invest in the country. Ramaphosa says, “Many companies represented by many of you here will come forward to make new investment commitments. They will do so because they see opportunity in this country. They see beyond the difficulties and challenges. They see reform and progress.” “They see an open society that has enabled us to weather many storms. They see a strong and vibrant democracy, a diverse media and an active civil society. They see durable institutions, an independent judiciary and the rule of law. After a decade of state capture, they see a country that is confronting corruption and criminality,” he adds. --SABC--
