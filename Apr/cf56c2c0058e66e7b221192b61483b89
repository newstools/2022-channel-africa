It will, however, translate to improved fortunes for local dealerships long inconvenienced by smuggled units from the neighbouring country. In a new directive by the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA), imports of vehicles older than nine years will from July 1, 2022, be cleared under the East Africa Community’s Single Customs Territory (SCT), which allows members of the bloc to jointly collect customs taxes. “Pursuant to section 64 (k) of the East African Customs Management Regulations 2010, the Uganda Revenue Authority wishes to inform the general public that effective July 1, 2022, motor vehicles of nine years old or more from the date of manufacture shall no longer be cleared under the warehousing regime,” URA said in a notice. “The customs clearance of such motor vehicles shall be facilitated under the Single Customs Territory arrangement where taxes will be paid upon arrival at the port of entry into the East African Community,” the Ugandan taxman added. Currently, importers of vehicles destined for the Uganda market are allowed to store their units in holding units approved by tax authorities, commonly referred to as bonded warehouses, pending payment of customs duties. This has been popular with many Ugandan importers because it eases liquidity pressure on them and encourages them to import more units some of which are later dumped in the more lucrative Kenyan market by crafty dealers. Most of the used cars sourced from Uganda, though cheaper, are much older than those in the Kenyan used vehicles market because Kampala had not put an age limit on imported second-hand automobiles. This implies that one can ship in a much older car through Uganda, declare low custom value and pay much lower taxes compared to direct importation into Kenya where the maximum age limit on used cars has been set at eight years, meaning that the car market in Kenya has newer and pricier vehicles. --TheEastAfrican--
