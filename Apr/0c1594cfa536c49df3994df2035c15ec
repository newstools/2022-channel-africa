Like the Public Investment Corporations (PIC), the forum has expressed transformation concerns around Rautenbach’s appointment. According to BMF, Rautenbach’s appointment is symbolic of corporate South Africa’s apathy towards transformation.
 
“Both the CEO and the financial director roles have been filled with white males and the bank only has one African on its Exco,” BMF says. 

“These appointments highlight the existing biases and untransformed organisational culture, which is dominant at the senior and top management levels,” BMF adds. The BMF also criticised Absa’s predominantly black board for appointing Rautenbach and not ensuring that a black CEO be appointed instead. “This appointment has been made by a predominantly black board which has not ensured that a black CEO be appointed.” According to the BMF’s website, the forum is “a non-racial, non-partisan and non-sexist organisation, focusing on the development of managerial leadership and the creation of managerial structures that are reflective of the demographics and values of the broader South African society.”
