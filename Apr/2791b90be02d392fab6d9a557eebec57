Sherif El-Sayyad, Head of the Export Council for Engineering Industries, said that the continuation of the boom in engineering exports is due to the current high external demand in light of the lack of supply from some countries, pointing out that the Egyptian engineering sectors need to reduce production costs in order to continue achieving export leaps over the coming years. He said the Russian-Ukrainian war affected the prices of raw materials all over the world, which puts strong pressure on the final prices of products not only in Egypt but in all markets. Executive Director of the Export Council, Mai Helmy, confirmed that the Council is continuing its activities to enter new markets, and that there is a response from some markets in Africa, where several agreements were signed between Egyptian companies and their counterparts in several countries such as Zambia and Nigeria. Helmy revealed that the Export Council for Engineering Industries held a meeting with Ambassador Mohamed Safwat, the Egyptian ambassador to Angola, to start preparations for the trade mission to Angola from June 27 to July 1, 2022, where the ambassador stated that there are many export opportunities for Egyptian companies in Angola country.  --EgyptToday--
