The study by Genesis Analytics, in partnership with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), concludes that over-indebtedness remains a challenge in SA. It found that more than 50% of South Africa’s credit-active consumers can be considered to have too much debt, which resulted in bad credit records for 48% of all borrowers. It is hard to believe that nearly half of the 27 million adults using credit have difficulty keeping up with debt repayments. In 2008, debt to disposable income was at 86%. It decreased to 72% in 2017. Thereafter, it rose steadily to approximately 77% in 2020, but declined slightly during in 2021. Now it is increasing again as consumers start to spend reserves they might have accumulated during months of forced austerity, and due to their need to ward off renewed hardship. “South Africa’s consumer credit market is highly regulated, according to the World Bank, and conforms with several good practices for financial consumer protection,” notes the FSCA. It says the credit market is large, well-developed and formally provides credit to more than 27 million people, equivalent to 67% of the adult population. The number of individuals with an active credit account reached a peak in 2020, as heightened financial distress due to the Covid-19 pandemic drove an increasing number of consumers to acquire credit. The number of credit active consumers rose from 17.12 million in 2017 to a peak of 27.4 million in 2020. There are 7 837 credit providers registered with the National Credit Regulator, ranging from banking institutions to non-banking lenders such as micro finance institutions, vehicle financiers and retailers offering store credit. --Moneyweb--
