In a letter dated January 4 2022, BDS chairperson Sabelo Williams wrote to Air Namibia's liquidators, David Bruni and Ian McLaren proposing to purchase 100% of the liquidated airline's assets. In November last year, BDS said it was in a position to offer N$3.2 billion ($210 million) for Air Namibia, with N$1.5 billion ($100 million) to be made available immediately for various disbursements to creditors, on the instruction of the joint liquidators. Bruni and McLaren on Wednesday wrote to the Pilots Association of Namibia's Heino Jakob to inform him that they have received an offer from BDS and that they intend to accept it. “The previous offer was withdrawn,” the liquidators said in the letter. However, no reasons have been provided regarding the withdrawal. --The Namibian--
