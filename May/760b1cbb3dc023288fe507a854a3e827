The 28-year-old American, known for his long driving, underwent surgery for a broken bone at the base of his left hand after missing the cut at last month's Masters. DeChambeau played a practice round, testing his wrist and blasting drives. "It was a huge ask for myself," DeChambeau told The Golf Channel. "I want to be 100% when I come back not 70%. Very disappointed. I want to give it my best. It's unfortunate." DeChambeau said his wrist felt week as he struggled to put his full strength behind blasts off the tee. "It started to feel like it was getting depleted of energy and I couldn't put my full weight into it," he said. --News24--
