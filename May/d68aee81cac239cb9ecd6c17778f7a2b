This as Africa is battling with economic recovery, looming food crisis and the effects of climate chang The bank’s Vice-President, Swazi Tshabalala, spoke in Accra, Ghana, where the institution is hosting its annual meeting. The Group says with its limited resources it won’t leave Africa in the lurch. It’s willing to be a strategic partner when it comes to industrialisation, improvement of quality of life and secure reliable energy. Tshabalala added that they are committed to assisting countries like South Africa as it seeks just energy transition. Tshabalala says this is a welcomed move and climate change has been a serious impediment. It’s also left a trail of destruction on the continent as it is dealing with deadly floods, desertification and other natural disasters. --SABC--
