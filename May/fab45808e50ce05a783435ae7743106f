The kit is launched to help nurses, other healthcare providers, governments and international organisations turn global strategy into meaningful local action and improved clinical practice on the ground. “Nurses have given their all in the fight against covid-19, Ebola, in disaster areas and in war zones. Yet, they continue to face under-staffing, lack of protection, heavy workloads, and low wages. It is time now to take real action to address workplace safety, protect nurses and safeguard their physical and mental health”, ICN President Dr Pamela Cipriano said. “Women form 70% of the global health workforce, but only 25% of leadership roles. They bear the burden of lower-paid, undervalued jobs and unpaid care and domestic work. We can help to empower women and promote gender equality by investing in nursing”, she said. The 2022 IND report acts as a strategic toolkit that aligns with key documents including the WHO Global Strategic Directions for Nursing and Midwifery: 2021-2025 and the International Centre for Nurse Migration’s Sustain and Retain in 2022 and Beyond. In particular, this work supports the implementation of the SDNM by providing practical guidance required by multiple stakeholders for effective realisation of their aims. It also showcases case studies as real-life examples in action. As such, it is a toolkit that provides multi-sectoral guidance to multiple stakeholders. While health workers represent less than 3% of the global population, they represented around 14% of covid-19 cases. In some countries, the proportion can be as high as 35%. --Channel Africa--
