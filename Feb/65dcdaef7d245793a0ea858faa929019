Goalkeeper Gabaski was the hero, saving two penalties as Egypt edged past hosts Cameroon in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw to set up an Africa Cup of Nations final against Senegal. Sunday's final sets up a tantalising meeting between Liverpool forwards Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane at the same venue  the Olembe Stadium in Cameroon's capital, Yaounde. An ill-tempered ending to normal time had seen Egypt coach Carlos Queiroz sent off for remonstrating with the referee and his assistant Wael Gomaa cautioned too. It means they will both be missing from the touchline for the final as Gomaa was also yellow carded in the quarter-final against Morocco. Meanwhile, Cameroon will face Burkina Faso in the third/fourth-place play-off, which has been brought forward a day to Saturday (19:00 GMT). This was a meeting between the two most successful teams in the competition's history with record seven-time winners Egypt up against Cameroon. The hosts had triumphed on five occasions with the last of those coming in 2017 when they defeated Thursday's opponents 2-1 in the final, but Egypt gained revenge on this occasion. As well as pitting club team-mates Salah and Mane up against each other, the final will be the first of three meetings between Egypt and Senegal over the next two months as they also contest a two-legged play-off for a place at the World Cup in Qatar. --BBC--
