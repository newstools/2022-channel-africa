Ivory Coast and Ghana, which together produce more than 60% of the world's cocoa, called on the EU earlier this year to join them in creating an economic pact which would ensure cocoa farmers earn a living wage. Most cocoa farmers in these countries live in extreme poverty, earning well under one US dollar a day. The EU is the leading destination for Ivorian cocoa, accounting for about 67% of the country's exports. But a newly proposed EU law could force cocoa traders to drop some suppliers because they use unethical practices. --Reuters--
