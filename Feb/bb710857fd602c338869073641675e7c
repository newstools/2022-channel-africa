It was reported that in many years there’s has been no record of a cyber-attack of this magnitude in Mozambique. Among the hacked pages, the Ministry of Defence, the Government Information Office, the National Institute of Information Technology, and others, stand out. A source linked to the Mozambican National Institute of Communications, said that the portals were already accessible and that nothing was changed by the hacks. Mozambique is one of the countries that invest the least in computer security. --Milton Maluleque/ChannelAfrica--
