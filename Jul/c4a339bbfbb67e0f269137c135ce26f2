Egypt's economy will grow fairly steadily over the coming three years, with inflation gradually declining from double digits and the Egyptian Pound weakening in the near-term, a Reuters poll showed. Gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to expand a median 5.5% in the fiscal year that began this month, according to a Reuters poll of 19 economists taken between July 6-20, up slightly from 5.2% predicted three months ago. The government is aiming for the same rate of 5.5%, State news agency, Middle East News Agency reported earlier this month. The economy grew 6.2% in the 2021/22 fiscal year that ended in June, the Planning Minister said earlier this month. Economic growth is expected to ease to 4.9% in the following 2023/24 fiscal year and quicken again to 5.4% in 2024/25. --Reuters--
