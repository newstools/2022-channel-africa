The Ministry of Justice said it accepted all but two of the 265 recommendations made by a commission that probed alleged crimes committed by the state under the despotic former leader from July 1994 to January 2017. Jammeh is living in exile in Equatorial Guinea, which has no extradition treaty with The Gambia. The government said it would prosecute all 70 alleged perpetrators named in the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission's twice-delayed report, including former vice president Isatou Njie-Saidy and members of the so-called "Junglers" hit squad. "For 22 years, Jammeh ruled The Gambia with an iron fist," the government wrote in a white paper. "During his regime, extrajudicial killings, rape, torture, enforced disappearances, and numerous grievous human rights violations became part and parcel of his military Junta." Abdoulie Fatty, a former local legal consultant for the commission, called the government's decision "unprecedented". "This level of acceptance of recommendations by government is extraordinary," he said. "The fact that there is strong emphasis for the prosecution of Jammeh and those who bear the greatest responsibility sends a strong message that government is serious about pursuing him and ensuring that he's held accountable for his crimes." The government said it was developing a "prosecution strategy" and would set up a special court located within The Gambia, with "the option of holding sittings in other countries". The truth commission had recommended prosecuting Jammeh and his accomplices in an internationalised tribunal in another West African country. "Impunity is a kind of incentive that we are not prepared to serve perpetrators," Justice Minister Dawda Jallow said in a speech Wednesday. "Their resolve to commit these atrocities cannot be stronger than our collective will as a society to hold them to account." --AfricaNews--
