Chad's Justice Minister, Ahmat Mahamat Alhabo, led a short ceremony at a prison near the capital where 22 detainees who'd been convicted of taking up arms against the government were released. Rebel groups have been invited to join national peace-building talks which are due to start next month. One of those officially pardoned, Samedi Torde Tanel, thanked those who made it possible, and said he hoped others could benefit from such a gesture in the future. The amnesty was proposed following President Idriss Déby's death at the battlefront last April. Chad's transitional military council is led by his son, Mahamat Idriss Déby. --BBC--
