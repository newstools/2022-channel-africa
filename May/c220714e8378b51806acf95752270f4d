The FairBreak Invitational, featuring England captain Heather Knight, West Indies skipper Stafanie Taylor and Pakistan's Sana Mir, opens on Wednesday accompanied by calls for better funding for the sport. Women's cricket has emerged as a marketing hit in recent years with international finals played at sold-out stadiums, including a record 86 000-plus at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the T20 World Cup decider in March 2020. Progress was halted by the pandemic but the sport bounced back with a successful World Cup in New Zealand, Australia beating Knight's England at a sold-out Hagley Oval last month. Knight, whose Barmy Army-sponsored FairBreak team includes players from Vanuatu and Rwanda, said it was time that women's cricket ended its financial reliance on the men's game. "I think there are discrepancies and certain things in the women's game," she told journalists at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Monday. "Sometimes the funding for example relies on the men's game which I think needs to change. "So I think this (tournament) is all about trying to help those associate nations, trying to grow the game globally." Women's cricket, much like the colonialism-rooted men's game, is heavily weighted towards a small group of well-funded countries that dominate international competition. The ICC-sanctioned event, brainchild of Australian entrepreneur Shaun Martyn, aims to develop the game across the world with players drawn from Bhutan, Tanzania, the Philippines and Japan, among others. "Some of them have never been in these sorts of stadiums," Knight said. "It definitely helps to develop players It's a breeding ground for players to improve." FairBreak Director of Cricket Geoff Lawson, a former Australia Test bowler, said the global talent pool ran deep with hundreds of players who could have been selected. --AFP--
