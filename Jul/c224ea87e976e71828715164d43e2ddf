The Kwacha has continued to demonstrate its overall stability for a couple of months now. A recent check shows that the Zambian Kwacha is now 1.04 to the South African Rand while one US Dollar is now 16.30 Zambian Kwacha. Chief Government Spokesperson, Chushi Kasanda, says the Zambian Kwacha is the second-best performing currency after the Russian Rubble owing to it gaining by over 30% against the Dollar in the last nine months. Meanwhile, the South African currency has hovered near 23-month lows in early trade on Friday, as the Dollar briefly paused its ascendancy after two Federal Reserve policymakers said they favoured a smaller rate rise to fight soaring inflation. Traders had ramped up bets that the Federal would go for a full percentage point at their meeting after hotter-than-expected US inflation data on Wednesday. The Dollar strength has come at the expense of riskier assets such as the Rand, underpinned by fears of a global recession, driving investors towards safe-haven assets. --ChannelAfrica-- The Zambian Kwacha is now stronger than our Rand. Great job ANC. You have made us the laughing stock of the world We will not be moved by an imaginery Zambian Kwacha that is being potrayed as a stronger currency than the Rand.The ordinary Zambians are not even getting the benefited of that 'strong kwacha' https://t.co/C6yFYESRSc The South African rand has slid to R16.92/$. Closing in on R17/$.Mostly due to the dollar’s surge in value, but also because of the severe economic impact of rolling blackouts on the South African economy.Weaker rand = higher inflation.
