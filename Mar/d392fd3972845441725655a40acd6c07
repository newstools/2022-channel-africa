The AA says petrol prices are expected to reach record highs of $1,58 dollars a litre and $1.56 dollars for Diesel. The AA says petrol is set to increase by 0.142 dollars a litre while diesel is expected to climb by almost 0.198 dollars a litre. Illuminating paraffin is projected to increase by 0.166 dollars a litre. The projected increases come amid western sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Russia is the third top producer of oil worldwide. Layton Beard, AA's spokesperson warns that should current market conditions persist, the hikes will see fuel levies once again pushed to record highs. “If realised at month end, these will be the biggest increases to fuel prices in South Africa’s history and will, undoubtedly, have major ramifications for all consumers and the economy in general. “We must note, though, that this is the mid-month outlook, and oil prices are for the moment see-sawing significantly. So, there may yet be some relief before the official adjustment by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy is made going into April,” the association’s statement further read.
