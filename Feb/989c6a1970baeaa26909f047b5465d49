At 10 a.m. EST Thursday, February 3, Batsirai was a category 4 storm with 130 mph winds, headed west-southwest at 5 mph(5km/h), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Radar from La Réunion showed that Batsirai had completed an eyewall replacement cycle early Thursday, and the cyclone was not as organized as it was on Wednesday. High wind shear of about 20 knots was interfering with intensification, and the atmosphere was on the dry side, with a mid-level relative humidity of 55%. Sea surface temperatures were a warm 28 degrees Celsius. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and most of the top intensity models predict that Batsirai will continue tracking west-southwest and gradually weaken, making landfall in east-central Madagascar around 12Z (3 p.m. local time) this Saturday, as a category 2 storm. The coast there is moderately populated, and damage from storm surge and wind is likely to be extensive. However, the biggest concern from Batsirai will be its widespread rains of 8-16” expected to affect a populated area. Batsari’s heavy rain area may end up just south of the most heavily populated city in the country, the capital of Antananarivo, but the nation’s third-largest city, Antsirabe (population 250 000) will likely get rains in excess of 10 inches. Unfortunately, Batsirai’s rains will mostly miss southern Madagascar, where a multiyear drought has 1.6 million people at high levels of acute food insecurity. Batsirai’s rains will likely cause extensive flooding and major damage to the country, and the storm has the potential to be one of the top five most expensive disasters in Malagasy history. The damage potential is higher than for previous storms of similar intensity, because of the considerable deforestation Madagascar has experienced over the past 20 years. Madagascar is already reeling from Tropical Storm Ana.  --yaleclimateconnections.org--
