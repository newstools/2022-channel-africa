During a meeting in Rabat, King Mohammed and the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said they were willing to usher in a new phase, "based on mutual respect, mutual trust, permanent consultation and frank and faithful Co-operation". In a statement, Sanchez reaffirmed the autonomy plan as a realistic option for Western Sahara. Morocco considers the former Spanish colony its own. But the Algeria-backed Polisario Front wants to establish its own state. --BBC--
