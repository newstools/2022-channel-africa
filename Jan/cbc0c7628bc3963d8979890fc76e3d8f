The Corruption Perception Index (CPI), organised by Transparency International (TI), ranks 180 countries and territories by the levels of perceived corruption in the public sector, on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 points (clean of perceived corruption). The average for Sub-Saharan Africa is 33 points, the lowest in the world, and 44 countries are ranked below 50 points. Among the Portuguese-speaking countries, Portugal appears in the index in 33rd position with 62 points, followed by Cape Verde (39th position, 58 points); São Tomé and Príncipe (68th position, 45 points); East Timor (82nd position, 41 points); Angola (136th position, 29 points), Guinea Bissau (162nd position, 21 points) and Equatorial Guinea, which occurs in 171st position, with only 17 points, and deserves some particularly critical remarks in the annual report of the Berlin-based non-governmental organisation (NGO). Angola which in the CPI 2021 has 29 points, up 7 points since the 2012 index is registering "a significant improvement" following the election of Lourenço, in 2017, who has taken significant steps to crack down on corruption, the TI report notes. The authorities have carried out high-level corruption investigations into members of the former ruling family, including the daughter of the former President and former head of State oil company, Sonangol, Isabel Dos Santos exposed by the 'Luanda Leaks' investigation and recently indicted by the United States government for 'significant corruption'", Transparency International points out. The report points out, however, another circumstance: "Investigations are rarely opened in other cases, raising doubts about the existence of selective justice". The organisation even stresses that "in a 2019 survey, 39% of Angolans said the President was using the fight against corruption as a tool against political rivals and a majority also said that those who denounced corruption were at risk of retaliation." --ChannelAfrica--
