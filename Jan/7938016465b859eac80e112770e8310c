While Australia's immigration minister continues to consider whether to cancel Djokovic's visa on Wednesday, the 20-times Grand Slam champion has been pressing ahead with his preparations for his title defence. Djokovic's announcement last week that he had a medical exemption to play despite being unvaccinated was met with uproar in Australia, which is battling an Omicron wave of infections and where more than 90% of the adult population is double vaccinated. Craig O'Shannessy, who worked as a strategy and tactical analyst for Djokovic, thinks that fury will almost certainly be vocalised by the crowds at Melbourne Park. "It is not going to be new to him," he told Reuters. "But even though he has the mental experience and toughness, this has the potential to be at a level, maybe, that we have not seen in tennis." The dressing room might not be the most welcoming place for Djokovic either, with some players resentful that he is not vaccinated. The ATP says 97 of the top 100 men are vaccinated and American world number 93 Tennys Sandgren has skipped the Australian Open, which starts on January 17, because of the double-dose mandate. --Reuters--
