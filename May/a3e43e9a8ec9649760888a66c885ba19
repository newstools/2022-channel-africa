The flotation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) would be the biggest on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange since at least 2016 and a major boost for the flagging index. But Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has shaken investor confidence and contributed to a plunge in volumes of IPOs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as rising commodity prices and disrupted supply chains undermine growth and call valuations into question. Two sources directly involved in the IPO told Reuters that Coca-Cola had aimed to list CCBA early in the second quarter, but that timetable had slipped to late in the third quarter. "It was broadly expected to be Q2, but it was also subject to market conditions," said one of the sources. "The idea is to do the IPO when there's a lot more predictability." The sources asked not to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the IPO. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola's largest African subsidiary CCBA announced in April last year that it would dual-list in Amsterdam and Johannesburg simultaneously within 18 months. CCBA said it was not able to comment beyond its April 2021 announcement to target an IPO in an "18-month period subject to market conditions". Coca-Cola, which holds 66.5% stake in CCBA, did not respond to a request for comment. --Reuters--
