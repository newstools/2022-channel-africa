Marketing experts say that while the platforms may not have clear rules, the advertising industry is regulated even online. 

Many clients who booked with Hello Darlings claim to have heard and seen the brand through the many promoters. Hello Darlings used many social media marketers to promote their holidays and exclusive packages. And many who booked with the travel company say they were introduced to the brand by its marketing campaign. However, many never declared overtly their involvement in the business and when tickets were cancelled and refunds were not honoured, many were still promoting the tours. “We were meant to leave on Friday 18. I booked because the influencer vouched for her, saying this was the only company that did refunds,” says one of the victims. As advertising has evolved over the years the roadside billboard has moved online which began the increase of the average person becoming a marketer.    

While some may believe the platforms do not have any rules for advertising the industry itself is regulated.
