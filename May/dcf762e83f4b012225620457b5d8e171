The Asian nation, whose lenders account for more than one-third of Zambia’s total external public liabilities, in April indicated that it would join the official creditors committee, breathing life to a process that had stalled. “It does make sense for our biggest creditor to play a leading part, to take a leading role in the proceedings,” Zambian Finance Minister, Situmbeko Musokotwane, said in an interview in Lusaka on Thursday. “They are willing to participate as a co-chair, and we welcome that because it will improve the chances of resolution, them being the biggest single creditors.” The first African nation to default during the pandemic has been struggling to rework its external debt, including $3 billion in Eurobonds, since 2020. A quick resolution will help the continent’s second-largest copper producer access concessional loans from the World Bank and the African Development Bank and make it easier for companies to tap international markets to fund expansion. --Moneyweb--
