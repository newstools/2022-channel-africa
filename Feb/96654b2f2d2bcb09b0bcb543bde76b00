City's surprise home loss to Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend ignited hopes of another exhilarating title race if Liverpool won their game in hand against Leeds, and that never looked in doubt. After taking a 15th-minute lead through Salah's penalty, the title chasers were unrelenting, as Joel Matip's first league goal of the season and another Salah spot-kick effectively put the game to bed before the interval. Salah was again instrumental in the move that led to Mane slotting home the fourth 10 minutes from time, before the Senegalese forward added his second in the 90th minute. Virgil van Dijk headed home the sixth in stoppage time to complete the perfect evening for Klopp's men and send a real message of intent to City. The victory, Liverpool's ninth in a row in all competitions, moved them on to 60 points from 26 matches, three behind the champions  the closest they have been to them since Christmas Day. Leeds slipped further into the relegation battle, remaining 15th and only three points clear of the bottom three. Given how close Liverpool and City are, the title could be decided on goal difference and this result will do Klopp's side a world of good in that regard. --Reuters--
