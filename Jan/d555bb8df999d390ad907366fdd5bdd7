Data from Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) yesterday showed that the industry outperformed and rose more than expected in November last year. StatsSA said mining production grew by 5.2% in November from a year ago, following an upwardly revised 2.2% rise in October. This mining production output was better than market estimates of a 4.25% increase, despite another month of severe load shedding in November. StatsSA said the largest positive contributors were PGMs, which rose 38.1% to the headline figure and iron ore at 9.3% in November. Investec economist Lara Hodes said mining production numbers further marked growth from PGMs buoyed the headline result. “Moreover, going forward PGMs are expected to benefit from pent-up demand in the automotive sector as input shortages that have plagued the sector ease,” Hodes said. At the same time, production rebounded for diamonds and manganese ore. By contrast, coal output continued to disappoint, declining for the fifth straight month, contracting by 7.9% in November. The other heavyweight, gold, has been declining since September, despite rising gold prices over the same period, and it fell by 1%. However, on a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, mining production shrank 2.2%, following a downwardly revised 3.1%rise in the prior month. In the three months ended November, production fell by 1.6% compared with the previous three months. Analysts said the mining sector needed to overcome its electricity supply and logistical challenges to operate optimally. --IOL--
