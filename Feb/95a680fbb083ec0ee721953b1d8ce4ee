TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael said last week that talks were under way and that there was hope to end the crisis peacefully. In his first parliamentary address since he was sworn for a new term in October, Abiy said: "I hear a lot about talks, but there have been no talks so far. However, because we have said we have not talked does not mean there will be no talk at all." Conflict broke out in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region in November 2020, and TPLF fighters advanced towards the capital, Addis Ababa, before being pushed back by government and allied forces. Tigray has also been hit by a severe food and health crisis, with little aid getting into the region. --BBC--
