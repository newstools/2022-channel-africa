Doctors from various groups have signed an open letter, demanding that health sector workers who blow the whistle on bad conditions for patients be protected. Over 130 doctors and medical professionals have also called for an investigation into the conduct of the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital Chief Executive Officer, Nozuko Mkabayi. It comes after Mkabayi instituted a disciplinary process against Dr Tim de Maayer, for speaking out against the poor conditions at the Johannesburg facility, claiming that the horrendous situations had contributed to the deaths and disability of children. SAMA's Chairperson, Dr Mvuyisi Mzukwa, says they have a serious problem with the Department of Health that cannot tolerate whistle-blowers.  “The other thing is that the people who are raising issues are people with solutions. “They are not just critical of the Department of Health, they are saying we are part of the solution. We need to stand for our patients and those colleagues who want to build the country”, said Mzukwa.  --SABC--
