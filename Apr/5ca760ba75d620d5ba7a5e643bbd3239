OCHA added in a report that access to south Libya was limited due to security situation, indicating that estimated number of internally displaced people dropped from about 200 000 in September to 179 000 at the end of November 2021. OCHA said most of the displaced in Benghazi had been enduring prolonged displacement since 2017, adding that the number of the displaced in south Libya decreased, especially those hosted in Murzuq by 50%. OCHA said the damage to infrastructure and houses is still the main hindrance to the return of most displaced families, adding that sustainable solutions are needed for those displaced families. --LibyaObserver--
