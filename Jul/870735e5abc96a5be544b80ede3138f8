He is promising to turn the East African nation into a major exporter of marijuana, snake venom and hyenas' testicles, although many question the feasibility of his plans. The 63-year-old Professor, who has a background in law, has proved to be the most eccentric of the four presidential candidates contesting the August 9 election. Polls have ranked the Roots Party candidate a poor third the latest one, released on July 11, gives him just 4% of the vote. But pundits say that for a first-time contestant he is doing well and the two front-runners will be worried about shedding even a single vote to him as the poll predicts a tight contest, putting veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga on 43% and Deputy President William Ruto on 39%. "Wajackoyah is running on an outrageous platform that would ordinarily be laughed out of town, but there is no doubt that he has captured the imagination of angry, disaffected youth in both urban and rural Kenya, cutting across all the regular ethnic, regional and party lines," writes Macharia Gaitho, a leading columnist with Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper. On the campaign trail, Wajackoyah tends to wear a tracksuit, T-shirt and headscarf rather than a smart suit, to show he is not part of the Kenyan establishment he accuses of rampant corruption. He also often gestures with his fingers as if he is smoking marijuana and drives crowds into a frenzy as he dances to reggae songs. Wajackoyah says if he wins, he will pass laws to regulate the farming and production of marijuana for industrial and medical use, to help solve two of Kenya's biggest problems, unemployment and a ballooning national debt. He claims it could earn Kenya more than nine trillion shillings ($76 billion) annually, and the government would "never have to borrow a single coin" again. "Western countries have legalised bhang (marijuana); why shouldn't we?" he says. --BBC--
