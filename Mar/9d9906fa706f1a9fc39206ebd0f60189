The Central African nation's unpopular anti-Covid measures were among the longest-running in Africa, sparking several protests in the two years since measures were first introduced. It is hoped Thursday's decree will see life return to some sense of normality. According to President Ali Bongo, 25% of Gabon's population has been vaccinated against the virus and transmission has steadily dropped with fewer than 10 new infections on average reported each day. Vaccinated people had previously been allowed to travel during curfew hours and to attend public gatherings, and this will now be extended to the rest of the population. --BBC--
