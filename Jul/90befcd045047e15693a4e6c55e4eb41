The public broadcaster is trying to encourage Non-Governmental Organisations, individuals and community members to share with us how they have been a helping hand in their spheres while using the #LendaHand on our social media and digital platforms and promoting 67 minutes of Mandela Day (July 18).

Happy Mandela Day/Month. Do your part. #LendaHand –ChannelAfrica–
