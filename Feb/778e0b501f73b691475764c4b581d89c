The coup took place on February 1, and resulted in an attack on the government Palace. The Chief of Staff of the armed forces has called it shameful that no barracks came out in defence of the President of the Republic and no one was arrested. Na Ntan's remarks were made during a visit to the command barracks in Bissau,  which he ordered a search for the perpetrators. Meanwhile, for a fortnight several houses in Bissau have been searched without a warrant at night looking for weapons and people. "I came here today with the aim of giving you a command directive from the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. “I did not come here to talk politics; I came here to give orders for mandatory execution. Whoever does not comply will be replaced," said General Na Ntan. The Chief of the General Staff called it "shameful" that his men "have done nothing, have not pursued" the perpetrators of the alleged coup attempt. On Thursday, the President named former Rear Admiral Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto, who was head of the Navy in the early 2000s, among three men he said had been arrested in connection with the attack. He named the other two as Tchamy Yala, also a former officer, and Papis Djeme, and said all three had been arrested. Embaló linked the attack to the transatlantic drug trade. --ChannelAfrica--
