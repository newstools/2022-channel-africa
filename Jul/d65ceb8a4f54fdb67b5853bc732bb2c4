He was speaking to Channel Africa during the official opening of the African Wildlife Foundation Kigali office, a side event that took place today. The opening took place ahead of the official opening of the weeklong International Union for Conservation of Nature, Africa Protected Areas Congress conference, which started in Rwanda on Monday. Desalegn says recent climate events like the floods in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province are a manifestation of biodiversity laws and the lack of conservation. “Leaders need to look at what they can do to work on conservation,” he said. Desalegn adds that conservation is essential at this point. “That’s why I committed to working on conservation issues throughout Africa,” he said. Conservation financing is likely going to be the key discussion during the conference. -- John Cassim/Channel Africa--
