Rana says most of the schools in the Eastern and Southern Africa’s region lost two years of academic. He says the loss in the education sector created a crisis as other children were victims of teenage pregnancy and child labour. "In many cases some of these children won’t come back to school again, however, we have to make an effort to try and bring them back." UNICEF’s stance comes on the back of International Day of Education which was observed this Monday. Rana states that the effect on learning is going to have enormous impact on children. "Before the pandemic started, what we call the Learning Poverty Read in Sub Sahara was 87%, which means every 10-year old child finishing primary will not be able to read a simple line and understand it, and its big issue, Rana added." He says even before the pandemic, there was a learning crisis which is now getting catastrophic. He adds that the huge loss of learning, coupled with a number of children missing out on basic foundation, the continent is bound to experience crisis. "If you look at the World Bank report, it states that there will be $17 trillion of learning loss by 2030 because of the Covid-19 pandemic." However, the UNICEF Education Advisor says despite all the challenges, countries on the Eastern and Southern Africa’s Region have been proactive and assisting in getting back to normal school routine.
