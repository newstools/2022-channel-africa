The South Africans beat a stubborn Zambia side by a solitary goal scored by Linda Maserame Motlhalo from the penalty spot. The two Southern African neighbours met in the first semi-final of the tournament on Monday evening, where Zambia wasted numerous chances to win the encounter. The Desiree Ellis-led side team will meet hosts Morocco in the final on Saturday. South African Football Association President, Danny Jordaan, praised the South African outfit.  

“Banyana Banyana achieved this feat on Mandela Day and marked it by clinching a place in the final. We send our congratulations to the team after this massive effort,” Jordaan said. Jordaan has also described Banyana as the best team at this year’s tournament. --SABC-- ….We can always count on The @Springboks & @Banyana_Banyana… a bunch of winners!! ð¥ðð½ð¿ð¦❤️ð¥³ð¤ð¾ ….We can always count on The @Springboks & @Banyana_Banyana… a bunch of winners!! ð¥ðð½ð¿ð¦❤️ð¥³ð¤ð¾ It is with a deep sense of pride that I congratulate the @Banyana_Banyana warriors on clinching a spot in the finals of the Women’s African Cup of Nations after defeating Zambia in the semi-finals.
