A senior official from the International Federation of the Red Cross, Denis Bariyanga, says about 160 000 households have been affected by the severe weather. Cyclone Emnati made landfall late on Tuesday night, bringing winds of over 100km/h, heavy rain and high waves. More than 30 000 people were evacuated from the country's south-eastern coast before the storm hit. The IFRC says there is a pressing need to find food, clean water and bedding for the people who've been displaced. Madagascar is prone to seasonal cyclones between November and April every year. --BBC--
