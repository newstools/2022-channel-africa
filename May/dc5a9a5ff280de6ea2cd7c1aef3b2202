The Egyptian-Tunisian Joint Higher Committee falls under a government vision that emphasizes win-win economic and technical cooperation between both countries in order to use regional trade integration as a tool to spur mutual economic benefits and investment opportunities. The committee’s agenda covers cooperation in a variety of priority issues, including technical and cooperation in trade, petroleum, energy, higher education, health, housing, finance, and transportation. The Egyptian delegation includes representatives of 22 ministries and national representatives headed by the Ministry of International Cooperation.
