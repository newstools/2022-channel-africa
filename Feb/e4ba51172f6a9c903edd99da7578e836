Kenyatta urged his supporters to back Odinga's bid saying that he had the best interests of the country at heart. He said Odinga understood where the country was heading, and that he would therefore be at peace to hand him the “leadership mantle”. Odinga will vie under the Azimio la Umoja (Swahili for "pledge of unity") alliance, which is made up of 10 parties, including his Orange Democratic Movement and Kenyatta’s Jubilee. Kenyatta’s backing of Odinga has led to the political isolation of Deputy President William Ruto, who will also be seeking the presidency under the United Democratic Alliance. Kenyatta and his deputy have been estranged since the president reconciled with Odinga in the aftermath of the 2017 election. --BBC--
