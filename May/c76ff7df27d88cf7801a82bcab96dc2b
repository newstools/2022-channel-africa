Cameroon's tenure will cover 10 substantives meetings. In a statement, the PSC said the meetings would centre on "governance and security challenges in the continent namely, unconstitutional change of government, humanitarian crises and terrorism". Cameroon's permanent representative to the AU said the meetings would be an opportunity to examine and compare the various efforts and challenges faced by African countries. Top of the list is security challenges in the Horn of Africa and the Lake Chad Basin, which covers seven countries, Algeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Libya, Niger, and Nigeria. On Tuesday, Al-Shabaab militants attacked a base housing African Union peacekeepers south-west of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, killing Burundian troops. This further compromises peace and security in the Horn of Africa and Moussa Faki Mahamat, the AU chairperson of the Commission called it a "heinous attack." The PSC became fully operational in early 2004. --BBC--
