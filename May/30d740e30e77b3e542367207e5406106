Namibia is investing in water facilities and is planning a second desalination plant to supply mines in the dry Erongo region in anticipation of higher uranium prices attracting investors, according to Finance Minister Ipumbu Shiimi. “There are a number of uranium projects in the pipeline just waiting for the price to recover,” Shiimi said in an interview from Davos. “If the price reaches $65 to $70 a pound, then that will trigger more investment in uranium.” There’s been a revival in demand for nuclear power since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as nations scramble to reduce their dependence on fossil fuel. That’s spurred a rally in uranium, with prices more than tripling from a 2016 low to $63.75 a pound in April. The United Kingdom plans to triple its installed nuclear power capacity by 2050, and Belgium is negotiating to keep two reactors open. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol plans to make nuclear energy central to the nation’s climate goals. California, birthplace of the United States anti-nuclear movement, is reconsidering plans to close its only remaining set of reactors. For now, only two of Namibia’s three mines are producing the nuclear fuel, Rossing Uranium Mine and Husab Uranium, controlled by Chinese investors. Australia’s Paladin Energy plans to resume commercial production at its Langer Heinrich mine by 2024. There are five mining areas under exploration in the country, according to the Namibian Uranium Association. Uranium prices, which touched a record in 2007, have been languishing for almost a decade. The recent rally in prices of other metals has also helped Namibia improve its trade balance, Shiimi said. The country’s next focus is on exporting energy to South Africa. In November, it chose Hyphen Hydrogen Energy for a $9.4 billion project that’s expected to produce 300 000 tons of green hydrogen a year. The country also has significant wind and solar resources. --News24--
