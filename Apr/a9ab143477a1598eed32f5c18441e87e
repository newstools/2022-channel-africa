A statement issued by the Guinea-Bissau Ministry of Social Communication's Inspectorate-General said Wednesday that the 72-hour deadline given by Minister Fernando Mendonca for 88 radio stations to regularise their "unpaid" broadcast licence situation had expired. "In the universe of 88 radios notified, to date only nine licence holders have appeared at the Ministry for the due purposes," indicates the communiqué, which points to the situation as continuing non-compliance. Following this, the authorities ordered the closure of 79 radio stations. "The Inspectorate General, in the use of its legal prerogatives considers that the radio stations that have not regularised their licences should cease broadcasting as of yesterday without delay," the statement said. The Government's decision is based on law 4/2013, indicates the closure order, which should affect national, regional and community radio stations. The document also notes that measures will be taken against defaulting stations that violate the order to cease broadcasting. The Journalists Union has scheduled a meeting for today with the Minister of Social Communication, Fernando Mendonça, to talk about the closure of 79 radio stations. --ChannelAfrica--
