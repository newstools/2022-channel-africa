They ascribed this to their very low salaries, coupled with high taxes of up to 40% of their earnings. According to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, his country’s economy expanded by 7.4% in 2021 and is projected to increase by an additional 5.5% this year. However, workers say this growth has not translated into tangible gains for them. President of the Federation of Education Unions of Zimbabwe, Richard Gundani says, “Today is a special day. It is a day that we observe in spite of the difficulties that we have had over the years, reaching rock bottom particularly this year as we observe Workers’ Day. The issue of conditions of service is what we are seized with. 

The nine unions that we are representing in education are making a strong voice to say, government and the employer must, as a matter of urgency, make sure that the issue of salaries has been addressed. It is a painful truth that the salaries are less than a third of the poverty line. It hurts that educators are working in an environment where their total remuneration cannot take them to work and work every day of the month.” General Secretary of Zimbabwe Agricultural Professionals Association, Zivaishe Zhou says most workers are forced to supplement their salaries with side incomes such as selling vegetables, groceries or second-hand clothes.
