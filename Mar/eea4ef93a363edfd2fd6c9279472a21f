The Ministry of Energy, in a statement on Monday, said that the $0.043 surcharge on a litre of petrol, diesel, and kerosene, imposed since July 2021, has been scrapped as the government monitors the international market in the face of the Eastern Europe conflict. The suspension will remain in place until May 2022. "Despite the fact that this decision will cause the government to lose about $12.95 million in monthly revenue, it is seen as necessary to protect the citizenry against the impacts of global oil prices worldwide," the ministry said. "If this decision had not been made, pump prices in Tanzania from March onwards would have become far too high for various reasons, including the war that is developing in Eastern Europe," it added. The statement said Energy Minister, January Makamba, had already signed the amendment to the legislation establishing the fuel levy. The price change will reflect in next month's pump prices review to be announced by the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority on March 2. The government introduced the fuel levy via the new Finance Act of 2021, which came into effect on July 1 last year, the start of the current financial year 2021/2022. --TheEastAfrican--
