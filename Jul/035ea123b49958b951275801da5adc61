In a statement, the non-profit organisation, which represents about 1 200 independently owned pharmacies, said medicines were not “normal” tradeable commodities. “They are prescribed by authorised prescribers, usually a doctor, for a diagnosed, treatable condition in a patient. The medicine is then checked and dispensed by a pharmacist. Both healthcare professionals have years of training and were strictly regulated through statutory councils,” it said. ICPA said it does not support the Post Office to be pick-up points for chronic medicines. There are 3 794 community pharmacies across South Africa, far over the 300 pick-up points put forward by the Post Office. “It would be in the interests of public health to utilise the pharmacy infrastructure already in place and rather have the Post Office concentrate on improving their parcel distribution, which they are trained to do,” it said. --IOL--
