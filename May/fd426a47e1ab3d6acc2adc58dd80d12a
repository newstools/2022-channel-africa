Their start-up journeys are also often a lot more arduous, say investors like Polo Leteka, co-founder of Alitheia IDF, the continent’s largest gender-led fund. The issues are “probably more pronounced here because we have more underlying problems,” said Leteka, pointing to her own experience with tapping investors for funds. “There was this mentality that African women are just supposed to sell tomatoes on the side of the road.” While surmounting such stereotypes is getting easier, huge barriers remain. For every $1 invested in women, $25 goes to men in the African start-up space, according to the World Bank. Companies founded or co-founded by African women, many with international alliances, networks and operations, drew 16% of the total $5.2 billion raised on the continent by start-ups, according to data from Partech. That compares with 14.7% of the pie in the US and 13.6% in Europe, Pitchbook data show. --Moneyweb--
