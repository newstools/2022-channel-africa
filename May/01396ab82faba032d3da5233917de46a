Eight years after the death of French journalist Camille Lepage, Non-Government Organisation (NGO) Reporters Without Borders denounced on Wednesday investigations that made no headway. The CAR and France opened investigations following the killing in a shoot-out between rival militia of the photojournalist. Reporters Without Borders regretted that some eyewitness were not heard and no reconstruction of the events was ordered. The lawyer of the Lepage family regretted a lack of “means and will” on the part of the French judiciary. In the CAR, the trial was postponed pending further investigation. In France, a fifth examining magistrate was appointed to lead the inquiry. "The judicial authorities must give themselves the means to move forward and to establish the truth. This is the least that we can expect", the head of the Africa bureau of Reporters without borders said. Camille Lepage died on May 12, 2014 in the CAR where a civil war erupted after the ouster of former President Bozizé in 2013. --AfricaNews--
