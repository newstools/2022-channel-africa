The move is in line with recent national competitions and is an expansion on the 23-man squads that had been used before the coronavirus pandemic. FIFA also said up to 15 substitutes can be named for a game, meaning no player misses out - something England head coach Gareth Southgate had called for. "I think everybody has to be available for all the games," he said in April. Southgate added: "If the squads are going to be bigger then it needs to be a situation where everybody is able to change on a matchday." The deadline for all 32 countries competing to submit their final squads is 20 October 30 days before the first game between Senegal and the Netherlands at the Al Thumama Stadium. FIFA also said that no more than 26 people  up to 15 substitutes and 11 team officials, of which one must be the team doctor  will be allowed to sit on the bench. England begin their campaign against Iran on the opening day, November 21, at 13:00 GMT, while Wales who are drawn in the same group - face the USA later at 19:00 GMT. --BBC--
