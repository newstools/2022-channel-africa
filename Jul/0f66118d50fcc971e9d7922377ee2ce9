Molopyane says this would lead to retrenchments. although mining companies have put in place plans to make sure that operations are not interrupted, there's a strong possibility that they will restructure or close in the coming years if power utility Eskom's rolling blackouts persist. The mining industry and organised labour have expressed concern at the continued load shedding. Last year, Statistics South Africa announced that mining recorded the highest growth rate in the first quarter. According to the report, mining recorded growth of 18.1%. However, there are challenges in the sector, created by on-going power outages. Last week, Eskom escalated load-shedding from stage four to stage six. The company blames this on the unprotected strike by workers and breakdowns at power plants. --SABC--
