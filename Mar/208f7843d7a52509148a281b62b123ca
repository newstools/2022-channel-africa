Headline earnings increased by 115% to just short of $78 million, compared with $35 million in 2020, that disastrous year of Covid-19 lockdowns. 

However, Brown told his audience of analysts, portfolio managers, staff and shareholders that earnings were still 7% below the 2019 figure of more than $83 billion.

As usual, Brown gave a short and comprehensive overview of the economy. Growth rebound "The operating environment in 2021 was more supportive for Nedbank and our clients. The South African economy performed better than we expected at the start of the year, resulting in upward revisions of gross domestic product growth to 4.9%. "Off the low base in 2020, the rebound in economic growth was underpinned by higher commodity prices, lower levels of lockdown restrictions and some positive developments on key reforms in South Africa. The low-interest-rate environment supported demand for retail credit and transactional activity increased as lockdown levels eased," says Brown. People are, on average, in a better financial position now, as evident by a lower debt-to-income ratio. "Households have delivered from a peak of debt-to-income of 79% to 68% and credit losses have decreased," says Brown. Banking activity has picked up sharply from a year ago. Management notes that the bank’s “high frequency data” from point-of-sale devices and card-related channels reflected strong growth in total turnover in the second half of the financial year.
