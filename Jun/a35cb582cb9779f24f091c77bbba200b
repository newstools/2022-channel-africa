IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati on Monday cited new information about the comedian’s academic qualifications. A presidential candidate in Kenya is required to have a university degree. The comedian was a student at Kenyatta University located in the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi, before he took up a popular comical role in early 2000s of mimicking former President Daniel arap Moi. Nyambane was the first presidential aspirant cleared by the commission last week on a Umoja Summit party ticket. But another aspirant, who was barred from contesting on Monday because of presenting transcripts without a university certificate, questioned why Nyambane had been cleared on similar grounds. It prompted the commission to summon Nyambane on Monday, but he failed to honour the summons leading to his disqualification. IEBC has so far cleared four presidential candidates David Mwaure, George Wajackoyah, Raila Odinga and William Ruto. The youngest presidential hopeful, Muthiora Kiriara, burnt his voters card after he was denied clearance for not having the required number of supporters’ signatures. --BBC-
