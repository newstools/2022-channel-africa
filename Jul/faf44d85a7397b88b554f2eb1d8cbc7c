Employees affiliated to the Public Service Association and NEHAWU have rejected the revised offer of around 1.3% after initially demanding a 12% increase. The union says SARS must present a better wage offer, or face continued nationwide pickets and strike action at border posts and offices. NEHAWU Spokesperson, Lwazi Nkolonzi, says they remain resolute on their demands. "In their view, 1.39% is an insult and it is way below the current inflation rate. “They have rejected that and hence we are in this position of recommencing the strike again." --ChannelAfrica--
