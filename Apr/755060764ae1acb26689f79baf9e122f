In his letter to the nation on Monday, Ramaphosa says a competent tax collection agency is at the heart of building a capable state as it enables the building of more social infrastructure and the support of the vulnerable through social grants and other measures. SARS has collected over $10 billion in preliminary tax revenue between April 2021 and March 2022, a 25% improvement from the previous year and a 15% increase over the last year prior to the COVID pandemic. It has also paid out its highest amount in tax refunds since its establishment 25 years ago. The President says much can be learnt from SARS in terms of efforts to strengthen state capacity and rebuild entities weakened by state capture. He says the focused turnaround strategy by SARS driven by recommendations of the 2018 Nugent Commission of Inquiry has seen improved information technology systems, the modernisation of customs, recruitment of skilled staff and efforts to combat tax avoidance and criminality.
