This is yet another expected painful blow to already struggling consumers. The increase is effective from the July 1, 2022, and will apply to electricity distributors and NamPower bulk customers, such as regional electricity distributors, local authorities, regional councils, and mines. The average bulk increase is 7.3%. NamPower reportedly submitted a tariff application for an effective bulk tariff increase of 12.78%, but after considerations, a lower average bulk tariff increase of 7.3% was approved. Namibia is considered to be one of the countries with the highest electricity costs, which are constantly on the rise.
