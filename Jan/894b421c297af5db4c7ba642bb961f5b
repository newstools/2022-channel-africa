Speaking to journalists in Praia, after a joint statement with the President of the Republic, José Maria Neves, the Head of Government said that at least five members of the Government have already been infected, but said that covid-19 is also affecting the offices. "I'm at this moment with an office practically at a standstill. It is affecting security people and it is affecting health professionals, which is where the action is much more complicated," he said. For the Prime Minister, the fewer doctors and nurses the country has available, the more difficult the health system's response system will become, not only to deal with covid-19-related issues, but also to treat other diseases, namely in the emergency service. In the communication, Ulisses Correia e Silva announced the hiring of more health staff, namely nurses, and, like the President of the Republic, called for a "closing of ranks" to fight the new coronavirus. The country has in recent days recorded daily records of new people infected with the new coronavirus, with 1025 on Tuesday, the day that confirmed the presence of the Ómicron variant circulating in the archipelago. At this moment, Cape Verde has an accumulated incidence rate of 810 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, a transmissibility rate of 2.52, a positivity rate of 21.2% and a hospital occupation rate of 30%. As for vaccination, by last Sunday, 84.1% of adults in the country had been immunised with the first dose, 70.8% with the second, 1.8% with the booster dose and 46.5% of minors aged 12 to 17 had also received the first dose. Last week, the government elevated the country to contingency status, until January 20, and tightened several rules to try to contain the spread of the virus in the country. As of Tuesday, Cape Verde had an accumulation of 44 592 cases of infection by the new coronavirus, 5 568 active cases, 38 643 cases considered recovered and 354 deaths caused by the disease.  --Channel Africa--
