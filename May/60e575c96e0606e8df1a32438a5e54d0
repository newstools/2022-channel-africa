Kaizer Chiefs’ Keegan Dolly is one of the biggest exclusions from the team, following a tough season riddled with injury struggles. Fortune Makaringe has also missed the cut as Broos trimmed his original 37-man squad by 14 men. Despite a stellar season, Mamelodi Sundowns’ Andile Jali has once again been overlooked by the Belgian tactician. Jali has been nominated for five awards including PSL Footballer of the season. Set to join the side for the first time, Cape Town City striker, Khanyisa Mayo, and Kaizer Chiefs’ Phathutshedzo Nange, received their first national call-ups. Skipper Ronwen Williams will be joined by AmaZulu’s Veli Mothwa and Chiefs’ Bruce Bvuma between the posts. Al Ahly’s Percy Tau will be spearheading the teams attack, alongside Orlando Pirates Thembinkosi Lorch, Fagrie Lakey and MSL based Bongokuhle Hlongwane. South Africa is drawn in Group K, which includes Liberia. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe has been suspended from international tournaments by FIFA due to political interference and won’t participate in the qualifiers. --SABC--
