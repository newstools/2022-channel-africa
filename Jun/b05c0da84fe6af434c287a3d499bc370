Local mayor Ekwalle Martin said more than 60 others were injured during Sunday's raid on the village of Obonyi II, in the South-West region. "The separatists wanted the inhabitants to pay them money each month, they refused, and that's why the gunmen attacked," he told the AFP new agency. On Tuesday Cameroon's army said it had freed a kidnapped senator and several other hostages. Elizabeth Regina Mundi was seized last month in the North-West region, where Anglophone separatists have mounted an armed campaign to break away from the mainly French-speaking country. The International Crisis Group says more than 6 000 people have been killed and more than 700 000 displaced in clashes between militants and security forces since 2017.
