The union opposed the deal, saying it would be detrimental to poor South Africans who are still struggling with the steep cost of communications. MTN is in talks to buy smaller domestic rival, Telkom, in a deal that would combine SA's second and third-largest telecommunications operators. MTN would pay for the partially State-owned company in shares or a combination of cash and stock, according to a statement issued last week. MTN says that talks with Telkom are at an early stage and there is no certainty that the merger will end up taking place. The company has advised shareholders to exercise caution when dealing with the company's securities until a further announcement is made. -- Bloomberg--
