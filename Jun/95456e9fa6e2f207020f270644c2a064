Under the constitution, President Muhammadu Buhari cannot run again, having served two terms. He has not publicly endorsed any of the 23 hopefuls who are standing at a meeting in Abuja of the All Progressives Congress. Whoever wins will lead the party against the main opposition candidate, the former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, in the election next February. The meeting has been overshadowed by the killing on Sunday of more than 20 Roman Catholic worshippers at a church in south-western Nigeria. --BBC--
