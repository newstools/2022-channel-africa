Army officers in Burkina Faso ousted President Roch Kabore on Monday in West Africa's third coup in nine months, after military takeovers in Mali and Guinea. The regional bloc has strongly condemned Kabore's ousting, saying he has been forced to resign under threat and intimidation. The coup comes amid an increasingly bloody militant insurgency that has killed thousands and displaced millions across West Africa's Sahel region, eroding faith in the countries' democratic leaders. --Reuters--
