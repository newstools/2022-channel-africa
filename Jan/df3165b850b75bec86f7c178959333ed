They argued that Tanesco was supposed to come up with a maintenance strategy that would not interfere much with production and economic activities. They also urged the national power utility to prioritise provision of electricity to manufacturing companies in order to maintain productivity. On Friday, Tanesco announced commencement of power rationing to pave the way for the expansion of Dar es Salaam Kinyerezi I power station. Tanesco’s Managing Director Maharage Chande made the announcement when inspecting the progress of the expansion work. Members of the business community, however, said did not object to maintenance plans, but said this should be done in such a manner that economic activities would not be hurt. Speaking to The Citizen, Tanzania business community Communications Director Stephen Chamla said Tanesco’s maintenance should not come as a surprise. “They knew about the maintenance. Hence, they needed to come up with a strategy that would allow them to conduct the service without necessarily hurting economic activities,” he said. He said electricity was no longer a luxury but a social and economic necessity to make life possible. “We don’t see how Tanesco will end this problem, but importantly, they are supposed to carry their activities without affecting economic activities,” he said. He said the announcement has come at a time businesses were struggling to revive their operations after they were negatively impacted by Covid-19, subjecting traders to serious challenges. Confederation of Tanzania Industries (CTI) advocacy and Policy Director Akida Mnyenyelwa said: “On the industrial side there will be serious consequences.” “Changes made at the national power utility including bringing in new faces had given me some hope, but I’m beginning to get worried,” he added. He noted that fish suppliers would be in even more precarious situation under the rationing. --TheCitizen--
