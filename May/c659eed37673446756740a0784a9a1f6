Eight miners got trapped hundreds of metres underground by flood waters last month in the Canadian-owned mine in Perkoa. Rescue operations were launched soon after to locate them. The mine has a depth of more than 710m. In a statement on Tuesday night, the government sent its condolences to the families of the victims and to the local communities. Search operations are continuing to find the other four missing miners. --BBC--
