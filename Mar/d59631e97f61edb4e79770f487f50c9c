The launch of the Women and Investing Hub coincides with International Women’s month and aims to support women in setting financial goals, save for their children’s education, invest for retirement and make other important financial decisions. Its development was inspired by a successful virtual conference hosted by Ninety One for nearly 2 000 women in August last year. With access to features including Q&As with leading female financial advisors on real-life financial issues and how to solve them, and advice on why you should invest in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, the Women and Investing Hub aims to inspire and empower women in their financial planning. “While many women lead households and play an increasingly active role in the economy, they still lag men disproportionately in earnings and savings. “Statistically, women outlive men by five years, yet they retire with 30 to 40% less money. And, while 85% of women manage everyday expenses, only 23% take the lead in long-term financial planning” said Ninety One Head of Marketing, Kotie Basson. “More than ever before, women are seeking advice and guidance and it is our hope that this support hub will provide the knowledge and tools for women to make financial and investment decisions, with small yet powerful steps that can have a big impact on their financial futures”, Basson added.  --Channel Africa--
