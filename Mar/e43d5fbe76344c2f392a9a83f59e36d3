The Paris-based Sudan Tribune website reported on Monday that Sudan was under pressure from Western countries to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But in its first official statement on the war, Sudan's ruling Sovereign Council merely said that it backs dialogue and a diplomatic solution. The deputy Head of the Sovereign Council, General Mohamed Hamdan "Hemeti" Dagolo, is on a visit to Moscow to strengthen ties between the two countries. The Foreign Ministry had denied reports that he had supported Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sudan's military leaders have maintained strong relations with Russia since the overthrow of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir in April 2019. --BBC--
