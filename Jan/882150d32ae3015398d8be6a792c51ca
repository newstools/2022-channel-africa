Gauteng continues to account for the bulk of new Omicron infections. The country has recorded 2 226 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, bringing the total number to 3 603 856.  Recoveries now stand at 3 443 535. The NICD says another 15 people died from COVID-19 in the latest 24 to 48 hour period. A total of 95 022 people have died from COVID 19 in South Africa but some experts warn the death toll could be as much as three times higher given the number of excess deaths recorded in the country since the start of the pandemic.
