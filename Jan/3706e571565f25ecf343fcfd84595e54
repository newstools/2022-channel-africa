Sixth seed Nadal, the only former Melbourne champion left in the men's draw, beat American Giron 6-1 6-4 6-2. The Spaniard is making his return to Grand Slam tennis after a five-month layoff with a foot injury. "I have had very challenging months, tough moments and a lot of doubts," he said on court. Nadal is the only member of the 'Big Three' competing in Melbourne after nine-time Melbourne champion Novak Djokovic's visa was cancelled on Sunday. His sole Australian Open title came in 2009 but he won the Melbourne Summer Set in the build-up to the tournament. He was rarely troubled against Giron, hitting 34 winners to help set up a second-round meeting with either home favourite Thanasi Kokkinakis or Germany's Yannick Hanfmann. "You never know when you come back from injuries - things are difficult and you go day by day," Nadal, 35, said. "But I'm staying positive. I won three matches and a title here last week." --Reuters--
