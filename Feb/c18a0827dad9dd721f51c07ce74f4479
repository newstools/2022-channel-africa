The men were arrested last week in Nairobi's upmarket Kilimani area, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said. Kenyan police said an international arrest warrant had been issued against them for the 2019 stabbing to death of a 16-year-old boy identified as Alex Smith in the London suburb of Camden. The UK's Metropolitan Police believe that one of the two arrested fugitives carried out the actual stabbing. The other suspect is alleged to have been riding in one of two stolen cars involved in the incident. Two other men are already serving their sentences in the UK for their role in the murder. --BBC--
