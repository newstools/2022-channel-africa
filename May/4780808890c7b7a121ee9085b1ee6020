Surging food and fuel prices from the war in Ukraine, renewed virus lockdowns in China and the United States unwinding coronavirus stimulus have clouded the outlook for the continent’s post-Covid-19 recovery. African policy makers will also need to consider portfolio outflows and exchange-rate weakness in emerging markets when they deliberate on interest-rate decisions this month. Countries like Kenya, Zambia and Angola where inflation is slowing or within target may leave rates unchanged to help support economic growth. Others, such as South Africa that are more connected with global markets through asset flows and commodity prices are likely to hike, according to Tatonga Rusike, sub-Saharan Africa economist at Bank of America. --Moneyweb--
