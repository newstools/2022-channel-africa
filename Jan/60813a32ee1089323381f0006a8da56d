A government statement said the inquest would shed light on the tragic incident. The crush happened when supporters tried to force their way into the Olembe stadium before a match between Cameroon and Comoros. More than 30 people were also injured. The venue was not meant to be full due to Covid restrictions, but eyewitnesses said it appeared crowded. The Confederation of African Football, which organises the tournament, has also launched its own investigation. Cameroon progressed to the quarter-finals beating a depleted Comoros side two- one. Cameroon will play The Gambia who beat Guinea 1-0. --BBC--
