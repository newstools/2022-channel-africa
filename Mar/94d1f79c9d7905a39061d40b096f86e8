Scores of people went to Pan Africa Mall in Alexandra north of Johannesburg, shutting down shops and removing streets vendors on Monday. Last night they blocked roads with burning tyres. The group has vowed to continue until all undocumented foreign nationals leave the township. They say they are not being xenophobic, but are protecting the economy. The hawkers and business owners meanwhile say they are simply trying to earn a living. Law enforcement agents are keeping a close eye to try and prevent any more violence from erupting. --SABC--
