The Central Energy Fund earlier said 93 octane could increase by R1,81 a litre and diesel by around R1,43 a litre. Illuminating paraffin is expected to jump by R1,66 a litre. The hikes could see petrol testing R27 a litre inland. In a statement, the AA says the eventual decision on the fuel price adjustments should in future not solely reside with government, but should include the private sector and civil organisations. In May, the Western Cape Government urged the National Minister for Transport Fikile Mbalula to take immediate action on the escalating fuel price. Western Cape Minister of Mobility Daylin Mitchell says the escalating prices will make it more expensive to live, eat and travel in South Africa. He says it will undoubtedly hit the most vulnerable residents the hardest. Mitchell says the national government has an obligation to limit the impact on residents by scrapping the general fuel levy. --SABC--
