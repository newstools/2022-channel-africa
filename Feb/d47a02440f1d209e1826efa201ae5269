A job that has proved to be more difficult every day. And the prospects, they say, are not the best. The opinion of the associations and people who help the most vulnerable families in Saint Vincent is unanimous: the situation is complicated. And several families have sought help. Last weekend, dozens of people sought the support of the Cape Verde Food Bank. For the President of this organisation, Ana Maria Hopffer Almada, unemployment and rising food prices have weakened the situation of these families. For the President of the Banco Alimentar Contra a Fome de Cabo Verde, Food Bank Against Hunger, there are several families in a vulnerable situation and with difficulties in making their daily meals. The proof of this, she said, is the increase in demand for support. Almada assures that the situation tends to get worse due to unemployment and the increase in food prices. The President of the Cape Verde Food Bank guarantees that the institution cannot respond to all requests for help and calls for the intervention of the authorities to solve this problem together. --ChannelAfrica--
