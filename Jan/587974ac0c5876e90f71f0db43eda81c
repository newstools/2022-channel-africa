This comes one month since the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF) launched aerial strikes, followed by joint ground operations with Congolese military, Forces Armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo (FARDC), against the rebel group. UPDF spokesperson Brig Flavia Byekwaso says the army incursion into eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has dislodged and scattered the ADF from their camps, but also killed 100 rebels, captured at least 43 and a further 61 surrendered. The joint forces captured Kambi Ya Yua, described as the headquarters and main training base of the ADF, just before Christmas. Other bases taken are Belu I, Belu II, Mombasa, Kambi Erumu in North Kivu and Ituru provinces in eastern DRC. Despite claims that many rebels have been killed, captured or have surrendered, the UPDF has not paraded any insurgents, claiming that most of these are being held by the FARDC and that for security purposes the operation cannot parade them yet. As the operation enters its second month, the army says the remaining ADF have fled to other camps, which are yet to be located. --TheEastAfrican--
