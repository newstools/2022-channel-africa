This comes after Botswana's Health Ministry announced the discovery of a new COVID-19 variant. Last week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the end of the National State of Disaster. Professor Karim said although there is no certainty on how the virus mutates, a new variant is highly likely. “The World Health Organisation is naming the new variants based on the Greek alphabets so we can expect that the next variant should be called PI”, Karim said. “How is PI going to look like, well we don’t know because it doesn't exist yet. But we can expect for PI to actually exist and to spread faster than Omicron, so if it doesn't spread faster than Omicron it won’t be able to displace Omicron”, Karim added. He said indications are that Pi will not only spread faster, but will infect more people quicker.  --SABC--
