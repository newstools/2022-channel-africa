Scheffler who missed the cut at last week’s PGA Championship in Tulsa, Oklahoma carded a bogey free four-under-par 66 to share the lead with fellow Americans Patrick Reed, Webb Simpson, Harold Varner the Third, Chris Kirk, Beau Hossler, Canadian Nick Taylor and Cam Davis of Australia. Scheffler started on the 10th hole and made three birdies on his outward nine, reaching the turn after back-to-back birdies on 17 and 18. He then had another at the seventh hole, his 16th for the day to announce himself at the Colonial Country Club. South Africa’s Dylan Frittelli is one stroke behind the leaders after a three-under-par-67, while Christiaan Bezuidenhout is a stroke further back in a tie for 16th. --SABC--
