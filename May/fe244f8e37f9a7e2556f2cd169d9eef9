Political Analyst, Levy Ndou, says this could change drastically, if he prioritises the needs of the working class in South Africa. On Sunday, Ramaphosa was booed, just minutes before addressing the Worker's Day Rally in Rustenburg, in the North West province. The rally was organised by Trade Union Federation, Congress of South African Trade Unions, meant to allow workers from across the country to reflect on their achievements as the working class. Ndou says this shows the extent to which the working class is frustrated with the current leadership. He says the sooner the ANC President realises that he will need the support from the entire tripartite alliance for second term of office, the better for him.
