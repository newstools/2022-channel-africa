As a result, Antonio Guterres announced that the UN would allocate $20 million from its Central Emergency Response Fund to meet immediate humanitarian needs in the region as he warned that the decisions of the coming days would shape the world and directly affect the lives of millions of people. This as the United States (UN) President, Joe Biden, announced additional sanctions against the Russian Federation, warning that President Vladimir Putin was the aggressor and that he and his country would bear the consequences. With the Security Council expected to vote on a draft resolution Friday that would demand Russia’s troop withdrawal from Ukraine among other measures, the UN Chief has continued to take a tough line against Moscow for what he views as a flagrant violation of the UN Charter. “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the UN. “The use of force by one country against another is the repudiation of the principles that every country has committed to uphold. This applies to the present military offensive. It is wrong. It is against the Charter. It is unacceptable. But it is not irreversible. I repeat my appeal from last night to President Putin: Stop the military operation. Bring the troops back to Russia.” In Washington, a new round of sanctions has been announced as Putin is labeled an aggressor and global pariah by the UN. -- SABC/Sherwin Bryce-Pease--
