Plainclothes officers arrested Bhiri, a former Justice Minister and Deputy President of Ennahdha, in the capital Tunis on Friday. The party said on Friday that Bhiri had been seized outside his house by the security forces and taken to unknown location. He has been the first senior leader and Ennahdha official to be detained since President Kais Saied dismissed Parliament in July and took over the powers of government. Ennahdha says it is holding President Saied and his ministerial responsible for Bhiri's safety and well-being. Earlier the speaker of the suspended Parliament urged the President to reveal the whereabouts and condition of Bhiri.  --sabc--
