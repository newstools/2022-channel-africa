In a statement the body said they now consider his death to be an established fact after seeing "witness statements, photographs, and social media material" provided by the prosecution. The ICC's first warrant for Werfalli's arrest was on August 15, 2017. He "was alleged to have directly committed and to have ordered the commission of murder as a war crime in the context of seven incidents, involving 33 persons" in Libya. He was also allegedly involved in an eighth incident when he allegedly shot dead 10 people, the ICC says. He was an alleged commander of Libya's elite al-Saiqa army brigade, a special unit within the country's national army. --BBC--
