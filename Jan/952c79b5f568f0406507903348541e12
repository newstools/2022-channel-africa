The UN’s peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) says armed youth from Murle community carried out attacks and cattle raids in Dungrut and Machined villages, killing 32 people from the Dinka Bor community. A number of children were reported to have drowned in the river while fleeing from the attackers. UNMISS is concerned that the attacks have led to people fleeing their homes. Jonglei state was recently affected by flooding and has in the past seen inter-ethnic conflict. --BBC--
