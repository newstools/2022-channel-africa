It says this is part of fighting the many social-ills in schools such as gender-based-violence, bullying and racism. Deputy Minister of Basic Education, Reginah Mhaule says the campaign will be conducted in conjunction with other government departments and other state entities. Speaking during the tabling of the department's budget vote for the year under review in Parliament, Mhaule says the main plan is to extend the initiative to include the next few financial years. “The multi-sectoral approach has been adopted by the department which recognises immensity of the challenges faced by all learners and educators in response to the trends posed by bullying and gender base violence and femicide. The campaign is supported by other sister departments such as the Department of Health, Social Development, Home Affairs, and Justice and constitutional development, communications and digital technologies as well the South Africa police services. The campaign will be rolled out in the remaining six provinces especially in the hot spot in the coming financial years.” --SABC--
