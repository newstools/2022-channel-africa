At this year's Investment Conference SAB made a $278 million investment pledge to the local economy. The beer maker says it believes in South Africa's growth potential and will continue to invest in the country. SAB Chief Executive Officer, Richard Rivett-Carnac, briefed the media in Sandton north of Johannesburg. “These investments will give us the capacity to not only contribute to the economy but also to be able to contribute to job creation, tax, excise and procurement spend.” “SAB’s Prospecton brewery in Durban will receive the bulk of this new investment with a total of R650-million ($40 million) that will help expand its facilities. This investment alone will provide a R3.1-billion ($190 million) additional tax revenue and generate 24 000 jobs through the full value chain. “Additionally, the investment will generate R4.4-billion($270 million) in additional gross domestic product for the KwaZulu-Natal economy.” According to Rivett-Carnac, the beer industry continues to make a significant contribution to the ailing South African economy. --SABC--
