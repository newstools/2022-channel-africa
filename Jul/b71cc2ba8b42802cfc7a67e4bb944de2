Myths and misinformation are some of the challenges that have slowed down the HPV vaccine drive mainly in the rural areas of the country. “I was afraid of being initiated into satanism. Friends and other people often told me that I will not conceive if I get vaccinated,” says Charity Banda a Grade 9 pupil at Muyoma Secondary School in Lusaka. At last she got the vaccine after dilly dallying for a long time. A registered pediatric nurse, Esnart Banda, at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka thinks myths and misconceptions are holding back many families from allowing their children to get the HIP vaccine. Banda advised parents and guardians to allow their children to get vaccinated against human papillomavirus in order to prevent the spread of cervical cancer.
