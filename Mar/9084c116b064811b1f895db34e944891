United States (US) President, Joe Biden, has labelled Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal while the United Kingdom mission to the UN, in a tweet announcing the meeting, called "Russia's illegal war on Ukraine" a threat to the wider international community. The UN now points to nearly 13 million people being directly impacted by the conflict. Council diplomats said that briefers will include the UN Secretariat, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Health Organisation as the plight of civilians in Ukraine becomes desperate. As the war enters a third week, there are more than 3 million refugees and over 2 million internally displaced people. Biden later tweeted that Putin was inflicting appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine, bombing apartment buildings and maternity wards. --Sherwin Bryce-Pease/SABC--
