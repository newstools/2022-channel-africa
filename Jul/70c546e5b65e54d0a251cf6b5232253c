The development comes as the country and its lenders seek to end a drawn-out restructuring process. After meeting on Monday, Zambia's bilateral creditors agreed to release a statement on their position sufficient for the IMF board to sign off on a $1.4 billion three-year program, the sources said. The creditors are due to release a positive statement, a third source said, without providing further details. In 2020, Zambia became the first African country to default on its debts in the pandemic era, struggling with external debts that reached $17.27 billion at the end of last year, according to government data. "The President is eager to see that Zambia's debt issue is quickly resolved and is happy that progress is being made," Presidential spokesperson Anthony Bwalya, told Reuters on Wednesday, without giving details.
