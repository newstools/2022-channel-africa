A previous attempt to change the constitution failed in 2014, after a draft document proposed to reduce the powers of the President and establishment of an independent electoral body. On Wednesday, Tanzania's ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi’s ideology and publicity secretary Shaka Hamdu Shaka said the party's top organ was "insisting" on a need to have a new constitution to support President Samia Suluhu's reconciliation efforts. Since 2014, the main opposition party Chadema and other parties have been pushing for a new constitution, which has seen their leaders and supporters get into trouble with the authorities. Some have been detained several times for holding meetings related to their campaign for the agenda,  including Chadema chaiperson Freeman Mbowe who was arrested last July. Former President John Magufuli, who ruled from November 2015 until his death in March last year, had declared there would be no constitutional reforms while he was president. During his tenure, opposition rallies were restricted.
