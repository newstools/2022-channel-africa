The board will also revoke the liquour licence of the establishment. In a statement, the Board's Chief Executive Officer Dr. Nombuyiselo Makala says the owner blatantly contravened the liquor act by serving alcohol to minors. Police Minister Bheki Cele says the deceased are aged between 13 and 17. Meanwhile, The National Liquor Traders convener Lucky Ntimane says the blame lies with the owner of the establishment. “This was a totally avoidable incident, and we clearly hold the tavern owner liable for whatever has happened there because everyone who goes into a tavern or place of enjoyment is at the hands of the person who owns that establishment. “We're sending our condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones in this tragic incident. These incidents happen way after the closing hours of such tavern, also that there were underage children in that establishment, this should never have happened. This tavern should be closed.” Local officials said they feared it was a case of under-age drinking gone wrong. President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his condolences, and said he was concerned that young people had gathered at a venue that should be off-limits to under-18s. --SABC--
