The commitments, totalling $7.1 billion, will allow Musk to reduce his own risk in the deal which has been approved by Twitter's board but not completed. Oracle co-founder and Musk's friend, Larry Ellison, is the single biggest contributor with $1 billion. Other investors include renowned Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital and crypto exchange Binance. There is still some uncertainty that Musk also chief executive of electric car maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, will pull off his planned buyout. Musk, whose rank as the world's richest person is tied to the value of his stake in Tesla, has said he plans to finance the purchase through a mix of loans, investments and cash. --BBC--
