The decision follows a meeting last week chaired by Kenya’s Principal Secretary for East African Community and Regional Development Kevit Desai, Uganda’s Agriculture David Kasura Kyomukama, and Kenya’s Fisheries, Aquaculture and Blue Economy Francis Owino, at the Malaba-Busia-Kenya-Uganda border. Owino and Kasura led the delegations to Lake Turkana and other fish sources. Kenyan fish farmers claim Ugandan officials had confiscated fish worth more than $400 000. “Trade in fish exports to DRC has been going on for many decades though with intermittent disruptions occasioned by misunderstanding between Kenya and Uganda on the nationality of the fish with Uganda often suspecting that the fish are undersize fish sourced from Ugandan waters, specifically Lakes Victoria and Kyoga,” said Desai. Kenyan fish traders operating in Busia town export fish to eastern parts of upper DRC that border Uganda. Their exports end up in Bukavu, Kisangani, Goma and other eastern DRC cities. However, Ugandan officials disputed the source of the fish claiming the Kenyan fish exports originate from Migingo Island and Lake Kyoga in Uganda, a claim that Kenyan fish traders denied. They also agreed to form a multi-agency team that will determine modalities of fish transportation from Kenya, through Uganda to the DRC. --TheEastAfrican--
