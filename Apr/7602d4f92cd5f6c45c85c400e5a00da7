Sasol is focusing on green hydrogen, made by machines called electrolyzers that are powered by the wind and sun, in South Africa’s northwest coast. The company is doing a feasibility study that it expects to complete in two years, according to Sasol’s Chief Executive Officer Fleetwood Grobler. Sasol will no longer consider gas supply from a planned pipeline stretching from fields in northern Mozambique to its South African operations because it doesn’t want to get stuck with the infrastructure as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, Grobler said. “The impetus for renewables like hydrogen has gone up a couple of notches in the last two months,” Grobler said in an interview. “What in my mind changes is that we should move quicker and faster on our hydrogen plays.” The surge in energy demand can help Sasol, which has been converting coal into synthetic products for more than half a century, pivot to cleaner fuels faster. South Africa’s second-biggest polluter didn’t even have a plan to transition to green energy until a little over a year ago, Grobler said. It is now like Shell and TotalEnergies, targeting to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The invasion of Ukraine has Europe searching for new energy sources to starve Russia of funds to fuel the war. Green hydrogen will be an important part of the mix. The European Union doubled its goal for green-hydrogen capacity to 80 gigawatts by 2030, compared with less than one gigawatt currently. The United Kingdom just set a target to produce at least 5 gigawatts of capacity by 2030. Still, it will take Sasol at least five years to begin exporting the clean fuel. The key will be to bring prices down from about $5.5 a kilogram to $1, Grobler said. The company plans to take on partners, but he declined to give an overall cost estimate. --Moneyweb--
