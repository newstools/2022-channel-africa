The facility will include a training centre, house a cadre of professionals that can respond to a medical emergency within its first 24 hours and stockpiles of medical equipment. The WHO says it wants to help create these quick response teams in every African country. "We see the continent expressing in very practical terms its determination to be better prepared for the next pandemic, this is going to be our contribution to helping countries build their capacity to be much better prepared and better able to respond,” WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti told Reuters. Kenya will become a regional hub for medical equipment, which will help neighbouring countries get required medicines faster. There was no timeline on when the hub would be fully operational but WHO will start work on helping countries identify and train national emergency responders immediately, Moeti said. --Reuters--
