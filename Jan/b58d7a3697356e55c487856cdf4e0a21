During the meeting, the Minister of International Co-operation noted that Egypt seeks to strengthen bilateral co-operation with regional partners and optimise the mutual benefits that both countries can obtain through this partnership. The Minister underscored the importance of reinvigorating the role of the Joint Higher Committee, as the last session was held in 2014, which reflects Egypt’s keenness to co-operate through a country-led engagement framework and joint committees. During the meeting, the Minister of International Co-operation highlighted the Ministry’s 2021 annual report, titled ‘Engaging for Impact Towards Our Common Future’. The report goes into further detail the groundwork behind total development financing agreements that were signed in the past year, which are worth $10.2 billion, including $8.7 billion for the public sector, and $1.56 billion for the private sector. Al-Mashat referred to the Ministry of International Co-operation’s mandate issued by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Egypt, No. 303 of 2004, which outlines a mission that clearly defines the importance of sustainable, inclusive development, innovative financing, efficient and effective monitoring of development projects, and continuous co-operation with development partners and all stakeholders. For his part, the Ambassador of Algeria echoed the Al-Mashat’s objectives in strengthening bilateral co-operation, which reflects the already existing partnership between the two countries. The annual report of the Ministry of International Co-operation for the year 2021, which was launched under the title "Engaging for Impact Towards Our Common Future", revealed the results of the joint committees that were held during the past year between Egypt, Jordan, South Sudan, Libya and Ukraine.  --EgyptToday--
