With less than 90 days until the August presidential election, the Chief Executive Officer of research company, TIFA, says 20% of registered voters do not know whom to vote for, compared to less than 10% in previous elections. “If the candidate who wins with a small margin, it’s likely to create a very tense situation where people could contest and say this vote was stolen or it’s not appropriate," Maggie Ireri said. She also notes that Kenya has seen an increase in polling companies in this election, and is calling for strict regulation of this rapidly growing sector. “There are a lot of pollsters out there. But the question is whether they are using the right methodology.” --BBC--
