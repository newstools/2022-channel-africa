The official death toll now stands at 445. Disaster management teams, including police and army, are still on the ground searching. But for many families the hopes of finding loved ones alive are dwindling. The floods have been described as the worst natural disaster to hit South Africa in decades. The cost of the damage is still being assessed, but initial estimates place the cost at more than $1.5 billion and counting. Major infrastructure was damaged by the rainfall, leaving many residents without running water and electricity for weeks. A national state of disaster is still in place after having been declared by President Cyril Ramaphosa, allowing the national government to put increased resources into the relief and recovery effort. --BBC--
