For many in the Southwest region, it is the worst rainy season in living memory. “I have lived in Tiko for more than 30 years but I have not witnessed this kind of rain,” a food vendor in the town told the BBC. Over the weekend, at least one child died in Tiko when their family home collapsed. The floods were triggered over the weekend by a sudden storm that swept through areas by the main road linking the towns of Likomba and Mutengene, which passes through Tiko town. Accompanied by wild winds, the rains knocked down trees and walls at the police college in Mutengene. Tiko resident Vincent Njume said: “I saw the Likomba River overflowing its banks, flooding with woods and household stuff. Trees were falling.”
Rocks and pebbles were cascading down the gentle sloping road linking Tiko and Mutengene, both towns at the foot of Mount Cameroon.
