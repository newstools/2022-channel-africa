In the past 18 months there have been six coups or attempted coups in Africa. The issue of peace and security as well as setting a new public health order in Africa, were also some of the main agenda items. With much to discuss and many problems to overcome, there was a lot to pack in to this two-day summit. Dominating large parts of the conversation was the resurgence of unconstitutional changes of government. So far, four countries where that have happened recently: Guinea, Mali, Sudan and Burkina Faso are suspended from the activities of the African union. AU Commissioner Political Affairs, Peace and Security, Bankole Adeoye says,” This assembly has placed on record that they have zero tolerance for military tolerance. It is important that the media should know that none of our leaders is in anyway justifying the trend that we are seeing. “Rather, they are all collectively wholesomely united in the same language of unequivocal condemnation of unconstitutional changes of government.” The AU has also raised concern on foreign military interference on the continent. --SABC--
