The forum, which started on Tuesday and ends tomorrow, acts as Africa’s investment market place where different global stakeholders come together to discuss and close financial deals meant to bridge Africa’s investment gaps. The forum is attended by at least 11 African heads of state, including Tanzania’s Samia Suluhu, Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, Democratic Republic of Congo’s Felix Tshisekedi, Nigeria’s Muhammadu Buhari, and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa. During the opening ceremony for the sessions, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, AfDB President and AIF Chairperson, said, “42 project deals with a combined value of $58 billion are expected to be closed during this forum.” During the last two such forums in 2018 and 2019, investment project deals worth a total of $80 billion were closed, Dr Adesina said. --TheEastAfrican--
