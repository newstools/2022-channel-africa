News24 reported paywall that Pandor "raised the ire" of Ramaphosa after her department issued a statement calling for Russia's immediate withdrawal from Ukraine. It quoted unnamed insiders as saying that he insisted that the South African government would not take sides in the war. The news site added that the governing African National Congress' international relations subcommittee is expected to throw the book at Pandor during a meeting on Monday. The Sunday Times reported that the president was "unhappy" about the strongly worded statement, with sources close to him claiming it “contradicts” South Africa’s position. “Ramaphosa did not see the statement before it was issued and does not agree with it. There are people within Department of International Relations and Cooperation with an agenda that we must be enemies with Russia," the Sunday Times quoted an unnamed source as saying. Pandor’s spokesperson Lunga Ngqengelele told the paper he was unaware of Ramaphosa being unhappy about the statement, and the call for the withdrawal of troops was to "give a chance for negotiations to take place". --BBC--
