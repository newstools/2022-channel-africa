After the request made to the diplomats accredited in the country by the Minister of Foreign Affairs last week, now the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructures, Osvaldo Abreu, says that the Executive is unable to respond to the suffering of the population. From the north to the south of the island of São Tomé, the disaster situation is beyond the authorities' capacity to intervene. The people's cry for help has come up against the government's inability to solve the problems caused by torrential rains. In Lembá, for more than a week, people from several localities of this district have been isolated, without food, electricity and drinking water. The rains that fell on the archipelago, especially on the island of Sao Tomé, on December 28, never seen in nearly 30 years, left two dead and a trail of destruction in public infrastructure and private property still unaccounted for. The government declared a state of calamity for a period of 15 days.  --Channel Africa--
