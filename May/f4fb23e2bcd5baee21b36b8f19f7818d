This is according to the new proposed rules being crafted by Addis Ababa. This means Kenyan banks which have had their sights on the Ethiopian market for years may be required to make acquisitions or form joint ventures with local partners in order to operate in the country. “The opening up might only be limited to regional banks in a joint venture basis with local banks,” a consultant spearheading the liberalisation process was quoted saying by Ethiopian publication The Reporter over the weekend. “That will be easily manageable for the central bank. The first target is to boost the foreign currency inflow. There are many legal framework revisions underway and many are in a draft stage.” Ethiopia in March this year constituted a committee to liberalise the banking sector, taking a major step in opening the door for Kenyan lenders to set up operations in the populous nation. The committee has already started work to amend Ethiopia’s half-a-century old financial code which locked foreign investment, meaning the long-awaited easing of restrictions on foreign banks making investments in Ethiopia has inched closer. The new code guiding the country’s banking sector will allow the opening up of the financial sector, the local Central bank said. “We are creating the right environment for that. Once we finalise the legal procedures revision, the banking sector will be opened,” Ethiopia Central Bank Governor Yinager Dessie was quoted saying by the local press last week. “The opening up will be done in a win-win situation, without affecting local banks. Opening up will highly benefit the economy, local banks and also other businesses.” The new Financial Service Code will determine engagement modalities of foreign banks in Ethiopia’s financial industry. --TheEastAfrican--
