At least 4.5 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian aid in the country, which is experiencing its worst drought in a decade. Livestock are dying and the price of essential goods like food and water is spiking. The number of people who have been internally displaced by the drought is said to be increasing at an alarming rate. Carcasses of dead goats, donkeys and cattle are scattered on the roadsides in south-western Somalia. New camps for internally displaced people are being set up. According to the United Nations, almost 700 000 people have been forced from their homes in search of food and water, and the numbers keep rising. There is a severe water shortage across the country and in the camps the situation is no different. This has led to a spike in diseases like cholera, measles and acute diarrhoea. Medical centres are witnessing a sharp increase in admissions of acutely malnourished children. Humanitarian agencies say there is a huge funding crisis. They only have 3% of what they say is needed to help the country. --BBC--
