On his State visit to Kenya, Hichilema said the continent must open its borders, implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to correct the anomaly, and ease trading between countries instead of using third parties. “How strange it is that sometimes Zambia trade in goods from Kenya through Europe and vice versa. Really? Does that make sense? Absolutely not. That’s what we want to fix,” he told guests at State House during a state banquet hosted by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The State dinner was held to celebrate Hichilema’s first trip to Kenya since he was elected last October. The leaders used the occasion to vow the opening of their borders to ‘fix’ what they called a series of trade barriers. Both countries belong to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), a 21-member trading bloc that includes countries as diverse as Tunisia and eSwatini, but all of which belong to the African Union. Since last year in March, African countries have been implementing the AfCFTA, which is seen as an ultimate solution to gradually eliminate trade barriers and make it easier to move goods between member states, and hopefully raise intra-African trade from the current 14%. Trade between Zambia and Kenya amounted to $39.16 million through products such as sugar, edible oils, textiles, toiletries, detergents, and crafts, among others.  --TheEastAfrican--
