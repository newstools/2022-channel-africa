The two countries account for a significant portion of the global output of sunflower oil, a soft commodity and the cooking oil preferred by the majority of South African households. According to the Corporate Finance Institution Soft commodities are “products that must be grown and cared for, such as agricultural produce, livestock, and related primary products.” The last consumer price inflation print released by Stats South Africa for February 2022 showed that the average prices of the oils and fats category rose by 22.7%, on a year-on-year basis. A significant increase relative to the overall inflation print of 5.7% for February was exacerbated by the Russia/Ukraine conflict that has tightened the global sunflower seed and oil market. Economist at Grain SA Corne Louw says, “Because they are such big players in the world market, it does influence our prices severely and that’s the scary thing. Prices are increasing sharply internationally and that obviously affects our food inflation and, in this case, sunflower oil prices.” An underlying driver for higher inflation more broadly remains the fuel price and that’s hitting farmers and raising their costs of production. --SABC--
