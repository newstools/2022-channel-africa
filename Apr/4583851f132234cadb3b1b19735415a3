Amir Aman, an AP accredited journalist, and his cameraman Tomas Engeda were arrested in November as they were covering a story about the violence in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. They were detained under terrorism laws, but have not been charged. The two have yet to be released and their lawyer, Melkamu Ogo, told the BBC it was possible the police might appeal. Amir’s family told the BBC they were excited to see him after four months and hoped their expectations would not be dashed again. “We are happy that he can walk out of jail now. We hope the police will respect the court's ruling, and he will be freed,” Nadir Aman, his younger brother, said. --BBC--
