Tanzania lost business after President John Magufuli, who died on March 17, 2021, downplayed the impact of coronavirus, leading to isolation of the country by the regional and international community. While the local economy was not affected by the shutdowns and lockdowns that were imposed by neighbouring East African states, Dar es Salaam lost a big chunk of international business and investments. According to World Bank’s 17th Tanzania Economic Update, released on March 1, the tough times saw the country borrowing non-concessional loans from lenders to keep the economy afloat. "The downgrade primarily reflected the collapse of tourism exports during the Covid-19 pandemic in a context of increased non-concessional borrowing and rising debt service," the Bank said. To help address the rising debt burden, the global lender has tipped Dar es Salaam, now under President Samia Suluhu, on key focus areas. They include enhancement of public-sector debt statistics, focusing on projects that promise clear socioeconomic payoffs and balancing emergency spending with broader development agenda. The World Bank has also called on Suluhu to step up her fight against Covid-19 to avert future shocks to the local economy. The Tanzanian leader broke ranks with her predecessor on the handling of the pandemic upon assuming office, with her administration keeping track of infections and making the reports public. --TheEastAfrican--
