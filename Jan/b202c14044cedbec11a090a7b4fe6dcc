During a Joint Permanent Committee meeting held in Kampala, officials from both countries also agreed to continue pursuing joint infrastructure projects. Uganda has over the years blamed Tanzania of instituting several non-tariff barriers that have thwarted seamless trade between the two countries. Uganda's trade volumes have been affected by the non-tariff barriers imposed by Tanzania. These include restrictions on exports such as sugar, milk and movement on Ugandan trucks. Tanzania’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Co-operation, Ambassador Liberata Mulamula, who led the Tanzanian delegation, said the two countries were committed to working closely for the betterment of their people through trade and infrastructure development. A joint permanent commission of ministers, permanent secretaries and government technocrats has for nearly four years held meetings to iron out issues affecting the trade between the two neighbours. In a 2019, in a Tanzania-Uganda business summit held in Dar es Salaam, former Tanzanian President John Magufuli said that the barriers making Uganda uneasy “can be solved” while Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni said “those putting the barriers don’t understand the importance of trade.” “I am delighted to learn that both delegations have heeded to the call by our two Heads of State to work together to eliminate all Non-Tariff Barriers to facilitate trade between our two countries. Trade is an important element for our mutual growth and prosperity,” said Okello Oryem, Uganda’s State Minister for Foreign Affairs. According to The Uganda Bureau of Statistics, major imports from Tanzania include gold, rice, trailers and semi-trailers, rolled iron and non-alloy steel, dried and salted fish, as well as wheat.  --TheEAstAfrican--
