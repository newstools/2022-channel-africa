This was in the wake of the murder of Zimbabwean national Elvis Nyathi in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, in the early hours of Thursday morning. Ramaphosa, speaking to South African Broadcasting Corporation on the side-lines of the Heads of Mission Conference in Pretoria on Thursday, says law enforcement authorities are keeping a close eye on developments. “The Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, was there on Wednesday night to help calm the situation. We will not condone any criminality and form of criminality which results in the death of one. It is not acceptable and we will take action to deal with it,” adds Ramaphosa. Cele was in the area again on Thursday following days of violence with locals accusing foreign nationals of being behind escalating crime in the area. It’s believed the mob arrived at Nyathi’s house after 10pm and shouted where are your passports. He was then dragged, pelted with stones, and was set alight. --SABC--
