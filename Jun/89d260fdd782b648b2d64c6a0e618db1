Sisulu says she is concerned that the looming liquidation of Comair, which operates the Kulula.com and British Airways services could have a dampening effect on the recovery of the tourism sector after a tough couple of years during the pandemic. The Minister has expressed the hope that the grounding of Comair does not lead to other airlines raising prices. Business rescue practitioners have lodged an application in court to convert the business rescue proceedings at Comair into liquidation proceedings. This followed the failure of attempts to raise cash to resume operations at Kulula.com and British Airways. Lawyers for the airline have requested for it to be liquidated after failing to get funding to keep the firm going. Company bosses said it had been affected by the coronavirus-related travel restrictions and the recent increase in fuel prices due to the Ukraine-Russian war. --SABC--
