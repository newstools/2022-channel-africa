This comes as the impact starts to be felt across economies, with global fuel prices hitting a high of above $100 per barrel last week, which will increase the cost of transport, manufacturing, and ultimately the cost of living. Moody's analytics notes significant escalation of the Ukraine-Russia conflict rattled equity markets and led to an increase in global oil prices, which likely had some risk premium already embedded. “The conflict will have a significant impact on economic growth in Eastern Europe, as it is the most reliant on Russian imports. The effect on the United States economy is tied to equity markets and oil prices,” Moodys said. Beyond Ukraine, the repercussions of the conflict pose significant economic risks in the region and around the world, IMF has affirmed. "We are assessing the potential implications, including for the functioning of the financial system, commodity markets, and thedirect impact on countries with economic ties to the region,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement. She added: “We stand ready to support our members as needed, in close coordination with our international partners.” She has termed the events in Ukraine “a matter of grave concern. First and foremost due to the human toll and suffering of ordinary people. The conflict is also having a serious economic impact, which will worsen the longer it continues,” Georgieva said. The crisis, she said, comes at a delicate time, when the global economy is recovering from the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic and threatens to undo some of the progress made.  --TheStar--
