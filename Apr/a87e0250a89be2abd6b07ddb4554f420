Elvis Nyathi was stoned and set alight in a mob attack on Wednesday night. The incident came amid protests by disgruntled residents over alleged murders and robberies in the area. Protestors had accused Nyathi of being in the country illegally. Muluti Phiri is an Advocacy Officer at CoRMSA, “We are deeply saddened by the occurrences at Diepsloot and CoRMSA would like to convey its condolences to the family of Nyathi. We deeply condemn the murder and we say that the crime cannot be condoned.” Phiri says it is important to note that crime, whether committed by South Africans or foreign nationals, the perpetrators should be brought to book and face the law. --SABC--
