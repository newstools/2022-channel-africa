Known as the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), the government had sought to overturn its rejection by lower courts. It was a lengthy ruling on a number of technical issues by the seven Supreme Court judges. Some points went in the government’s favour, but in essence the ruling means the proposal cannot proceed. A majority of the judges agreed with the lower courts that such changes to the constitution should be citizen-led rather than initiated by a Head of State. They also said the creation of 70 new constituencies without public participation was unconstitutional. As well as creating more MPs, the idea had been to expand the executive to include a Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers. BBI was the brainchild of Kenyatta and his former rival, opposition leader Raila Odinga but it was not backed by Deputy President William Ruto, who has fallen out with his boss. As a result, it has become linked to the battle to succeed Kenyatta, who is due to step down in August after serving two terms. --BBC--
