Ria Ledwaba will be challenging Danny Jordaan for the SAFA presidency next month, a position Radebe was eager to attain four years ago before having to withdraw. In 2018, Radebe was a fan favourite in the race to dethrone Jordaan, but his lack of administrative experience in SAFA's structures proved detrimental. Jordaan will have served nine years as president in September, and his time as head honcho has come under severe scrutiny by South Africans. Radebe wants change and believes footballers must have a say when it comes to the game, including administrative issues. --News24--
