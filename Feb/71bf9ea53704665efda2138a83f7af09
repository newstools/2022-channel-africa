The news comes as a relief to more than 1 000 employees whose contracts would have been terminated at the end of June. Base Titanium, which has also started exploration in Tanzania and is eyeing Madagascar to extend its mining exploration in Africa, is allowed to operate in Kenya till November 2023. “Base Titanium is fully industrial. “That is where we are aiming as a country, to encourage Kenyans to tap into and exploit the lucrative mining sector,” said Petroleum and Mining Principal Secretary Andrew Kamau. If the firm gets another licence on the variation of Bumamani area in North Coast, it will extend operations by a further six months until June 2024. Base Titanium’s General Manager for External Affairs Simon Wall expressed optimism after the renewal of the licence. “The government finalised a variation to our mining licence last year that provided us with an extra 13 months to continue through to 2023. “Minerals within our mining tenure area will be depleted, but we have a boundary variation location with the government, which will take us up to June 2024,” said Wall. He said the firm is at the back end of the project at the Coast as they identify satellite deposits. Early last year, Base Titanium officials set up a company known as Base Explorations Tanzania, and applied for licences. --TheEastAfrican--
