The opposition highlighted mismanagement, lack of consequences, looting and corruption as some of the things that they say brought the power utility to the ground. In its defence the ruling party says there is progress in allowing Eskom to conduct maintenance without electricity interruptions. The debate takes places when Eskom is implementing loadshedding which is set to continue until next week. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which sponsored the debate, says the power utility has become a national and an international embarrassment since 2007. The IFP’s Mkhuleko Hlengwa says: “Eskom has become a curse word in every household in our country, Why?… Because this entity is unable to deliver on its fundamental mandate which is to generate enough energy to our national grid. We have to deal with weekly breakdowns and other maintenance related issues.” Some parties accused the government of moving at a snail’s pace in fixing the challenges facing Eskom. The Democratic Alliance’s Kevin Mileham says: “Three months’ outlook indicates a rough road ahead there’s a risk of more loadshedding. Government appears to be in complete denial of the seriousness of the electricity crisis.” --SABC--
