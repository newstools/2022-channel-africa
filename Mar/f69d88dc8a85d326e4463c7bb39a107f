It comes a day after a delegation of European Union ambassadors in Tanzania called on the country and other African countries to raise their voices against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Tanzania's stance is echoed by its decision not to vote on a United Nationa General Assembly resolution adopted earlier this month, calling on Russia to immediately suspend its attacks on Ukraine and withdraw its troops from the country. Liberata Mulamula, Tanzania’s Foreign Minister, says Tanzania does not support war and believes that best way forward is to promote peace talks through diplomatic means. “We are against wars, but we decided to be neutral. “We stand by our policies and specifically our foreign policy which is clear that we can’t align with any party, especially in a situation like this,” she further said. --BBC--
