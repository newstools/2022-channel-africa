Motsoaledi argues that Zimbabweans who hold the permit are given until the end of December to migrate to other permits. The foundation has launched a court action to challenge the expiry of the permit in court. The Zimbabwean exemption permit, which has been in existence for 13 years, will expire at the end of this year, throwing the lives of thousands of Zimbabweans who benefit from it in disarray. The foundation says the decision will affect as many as 178 000 Zimbabwean nationals with exemption permits. Motsoaledi however says his department will vigorously defend what he calls the lawful, reasonable and rational decision to terminate the permit. “We engaged with people who are affected and some of the civil society organisations who wrote to us and say they want engagement. I have several engagements, some of them in writing, there are even legal groups in Zimbabwe who said they are representing them and they want to come and engage with us and we engaged them”, says Motsoaledi.  --SABC--
