This brings the repo to 5.5% and the prime rate to 9%. Kganyago said three members of the Monetary Policy Committee supported the hike, while one wanted 100 basis points and another preferred a 50 basis point hike. This is the biggest hike since September 2002, when the repo rate was hiked by 100 basis points amid an emerging market crisis. Kganyago says many developing countries are yet to fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and global economies remain fragile. Economist Johann Els says the Reserve Bank's decision to hike rates was informed by worse-than-anticipated inflation numbers. On the other hand, the Congress of South African Trade Unions says the decision by the Reserve Bank will have a devastating impact on both consumers and the economy. The Federation believes that the Reserve Bank should have increased the rates by a smaller percentage. The Federation’s Parliamentary Co-ordinator, Matthew Parks, described the increase as a huge blow to the workers. “It's a huge blow, it means that workers have less money to take home to care for their families. “It means workers’ home loan payments, credit cards, store payments and whatever debt they might have will be more expensive. This is devastating to the economy. We condemn the Reserve Bank for doing this," Parks said. --News24/SABC--
