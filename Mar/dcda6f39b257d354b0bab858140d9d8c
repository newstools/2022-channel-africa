Host Paul Kagame stressed the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Area, according to a note posted on the President of Guinea-Bissau's Facebook page. Embaló and Paul Kagame held bilateral talks and witnessed the signing of memoranda of understanding on economic cooperation, trade, education, tourism, business events and conservation by the foreign ministers of both countries In his remarks, Kagame highlighted the fact that Africa is big and there is room for all. "The African Continental Free Trade Area offers many opportunities to engage constructively. At the same time, the threats are transnational and affect us all equally. Joining forces and learning from each other can only make us much stronger," said Rwanda's head of state. For his part, Embaló pointed out that "the distance between Bissau and Kigali is about six hours, which is not much. I believe there is a lot we can do together with our sister Republic of Rwanda. We can exchange experiences in various areas. South-South cooperation is beneficial, dynamic and objective," said the Guinean President who paid tribute to all the victims of the genocide at the "Kigali Genocide Memorial". On Wednesday, Embaló will travel to Turkey where he will participate until March 13 in the Antalya Diplomacy Forum. The President is accompanied by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Suzi Barbosa. ---Bissau-Jacob Tivane/ ChannelAfrica--
