Angelique Coetzee is a South African doctor who first spotted the Omicron coronavirus variant last year. "We should not let our guards down," she told BBC Newsday. "We are not out of the pandemic, we still have over 1 000 new cases per day. But we have seen that the average citizen out there is not adhering to restrictions." She said ventilation, hand-washing, sanitation and water were vital in controlling the spread of coronavirus not just "pharmaceutical interventions" such as vaccines. Labour union Solidarity were reportedly due to have their case against the health ministry heard in court on Tuesday, but before that could happen the end of so-called state of disaster was announced. --BBC--
