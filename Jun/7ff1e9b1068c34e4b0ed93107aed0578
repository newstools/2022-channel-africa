The Polish Airlines flight no. LO149 arrived at Cairo Airport Tuesday evening with 100 passengers on board. Flights will be operating between the two cities with an average of five flights per week. On Sunday, Polish President Andrzej Duda and First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda wife arrived in Cairo in a three-day visit, where they met with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. The talks between both presidents reflected the importance of the bilateral relations, which extend for 100 years. Ambassador Hussein Haridi, former assistant Foreign Minister, said in phone statements, that the Polish President's visit to Egypt comes within the desire to strengthen diplomatic relations that go back a long time. He explained that Sisi welcomed Poland's decision to resume flights between Cairo and Warsaw again in light of the decline in the volume of Russian and Ukrainian tourism, which represents 20% of tourism coming to Egypt each year. --EgyptToday--
