Coach Aaron Mutede is working with six  players at the moment which should make up the team for the March 31 -April 3 tournament in South Africa. They are Hellen Matembedza, Apronage  Ngorima, Chantal Mutede, Lorraine Gwarada, Charloty Chemhere, Andrea Ottoman. Their preparations have received a boost after they were allowed to use the national team volleyball court for their training sessions while national team coach Vengai Nyaude has offered to help the squad. Mutede said they were looking for more sponsors to help the team in their preparations for the important tournament. “We have managed to get a good beach volleyball court in Harare to use as training venue and starting Monday next week will be in full camp. We also got assistance from national team beach volleyball coach who has volunteered to work with the players,” Mutede said. Talented youngster Ngorima is also champing at the bit. He was part of the team that played in the first leg of the tour in Mozambique and believes the experience that they gained in Maputo will be invaluable. --Newsday.co.zw--
