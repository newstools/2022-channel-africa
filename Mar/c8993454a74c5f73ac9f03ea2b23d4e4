The country's statistics office announced Wednesday that the consumer price index (CPI) increase between February 2021 and February 2022 was 15.70%, higher than 15.60% recorded in January, The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the prices of goods and services, measured by the Consumer Price Index, fell 1.63% points lower than the rate recorded in February 2021 (17.33%). The rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals, food products, potatoes, yam and other tubers, oils and fats and fruit, according to the NBS. “The percentage change in the average composite CPI for the 12 months period ending February 2022 over the average of the CPI for the previous 12 months period was 16.73%, showing 0.14% point from 16.87% recorded in January 2022,” the stats office disclosed in its report. Nigeria has faced fuel shortages since February after importing substandard fuel which resulted in weeks of severe scarcity and long queues at filling stations.
