This follows a declaration made by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organsation member states in November 2021. Kiswahili is one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa and the most widely spoken in sub-Saharan Africa. Today’s commemorations come on the back of Uganda's cabinet approving the adoption of the language as an official language. In a statement, the cabinet said the decision followed a directive by the East African Community bloc to adopt the language to ease communication among member countries. The Ugandan cabinet also recommended that the teaching of Kiswahili in primary and secondary should be made compulsory. Swahili, which originated in East Africa, is one of the world's 10 most widely spoken languages with about 200 million speakers. The language and its dialects is spoken from parts of Somalia down to Mozambique and across the Democratic Republic of Congo. To celebrate the day, the Tanzanian Embassy in South Africa, is hosting an event.
