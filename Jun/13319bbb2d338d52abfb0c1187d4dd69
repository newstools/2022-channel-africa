The ceremonious handover comes after a lengthy delay for which Zondo has since apologised. The handover also comes after two postponements after Zondo said he still had to peruse through the documents before submitting it to the President. The reports mark the last work of the Commission that spanned over four years. The commission's chairperson has also recommended that election rules be amended to allow for South Africans to directly elect a President instead of using the party system. This, he says, will prevent the country having another leader such as former South African President Jacob Zuma. Ramaphosa must now decide whether further legal action should be taken against his predecessor. Zondo addressed the media at the Union Buildings in the capital, Pretoria, at the official handover ceremony. --SABC--
