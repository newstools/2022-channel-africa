It centres on a diplomatic row after 49 Ivorian soldiers arrested in Bamako were accused of mercenary activities 10 days ago. This comes after Togo initiated mediation efforts between Mali and Ivory Coast to resolve the issue. Ivory Coast insists the troops were not mercenaries, but were there to support Minusma, under an agreed contract between the two countries. According to Bamako, Salgado tweeted without any proof, that the Malian authorities had been previously informed of the arrival of the 49 Ivorian soldiers by civilian flight. Salgado was asked to provide proof of the statements Mali says he made online, or, to make the necessary corrections, but he did not, according to Mali's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation. The ministry said it could not remain silent about these actions, which it says undermined the partnership with Minusma and other partners. However, it also reiterated its desire to maintain dialogue and co-operate with all its international partners, including Minusma. --BBC--
