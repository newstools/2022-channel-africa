This comes after the Guinean Public Ministry intends to hear Pereira in relation to the well-known Resgate case, which investigates alleged acts of corruption in the PAIGC government in 2015. The Attorney General's Office of Guinea-Bissau has asked the ANP to lift the immunity of MP Pereira, President of the PAIGC, to answer on the known "ransom case", which investigates alleged corruption in the government of the party of the liberators. The information was advanced by the ANP Communication Office. The request to lift the immunity of the President of the main opposition party comes on the eve of the PAIGC's 10th Congress, which was due to start this Thursday but was postponed to March 10-13  due to restrictions imposed by the fight against Covid-19. In June 2017, the Public Ministry concluded investigations related to the case known as "Resgate", a process that involved the licensing of commercial banks and in which the Ministries of Economy and Finance, of the then PAIGC government, were said to be implicated. --Casimiro Cajucam/ChannelAfrica--
