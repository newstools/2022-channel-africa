The comment follows the prosecution of opposition members, journalists and activists by judicial authorities in Rwanda on the basis of their speech and opinions. In an exclusive interview with Channel Africa, Lewis Mudge, Central Africa Director at Human Rights Watch, says what’s happening in Rwanda is not new. Mudge says social media users have previously been prosecuted for criticising State policy, adding that even individuals who want to have degree of freedom of expression in regards to issuing media statement via the internet have experienced the same challenge. In a new report released by HRW, as Rwanda prepares to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in June, the global rights group is urging the international community to take a stand and pressure authorities to stop the politically-motivated prosecutions. The report highlights a YouTuber with 15 million views, who was charged with humiliating public officials after he published a series of videos accusing soldiers of abusing people living in slums. While HRW recognises the government’s concern about speech leading to violence, it says that what it sees in the country is the complete banning of debates, opinions, and criticism of government policies. The Rwandan government, led by President Paul Kagame, has not responded to the report.  --ChannelAfrica--
