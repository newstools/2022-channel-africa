Mott, 48, won Twenty20 world cups in 2018 and 2020 and the 50-over equivalent earlier this year during his seven-year stint with the Australian national side. He also guided the team to a record 26 successive one-day international wins and victory over England in the recent multi-format Ashes series. Mott, who has previously worked in the English county game with Glamorgan, takes over an England men's side who are the reigning 50-over world champions and currently second in the one-day international and T20 rankings. England's new managing director Rob Key said the Australian's mentality dovetailed with that of World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan. "What he has been able to do with them (Australia's women's team) I don't think should be underestimated," said Key, who was appointed as part of a management revamp following England's embarrassing 4-0 Ashes defeat in Australia. "He has made the gap greater between (Australia and) the rest of the pack in the women's game." --News24--
