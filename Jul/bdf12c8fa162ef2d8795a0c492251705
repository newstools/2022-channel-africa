The lender says the funding will target 20 million small-holder African farmers, to end reliance on food imports from Russia and Ukraine. Farmers will receive certified seeds and improved access to fertilisers, while the funds will also support governance and policy reform to boost investment in Africa's agriculture. According to the AfDB, the ongoing war has left Africa with a food deficit of at least 30 million tons. If the plan is successful, African farmers are expected to produce about 11 million tons of wheat, 18 million tons of maize, six million tons of rice and 2.5 million tons of soybeans over the next two years, exceeding imports from Russia and Ukraine. --Channel Africa--
