The 61-year-old spent just 12 games at the helm of the Cairo club from October 2015 to January 2016 before returning to his homeland with the Dragons. However, Peseiro lasted only four months in the hot seat after being sacked by the 29-time Primeira Liga champions following a poor record at Estadio do Dragao. He looked set to take charge of the Super Eagles this month after the Africa Cup of Nations, but the Nigeria Football Federation decided to stick with Augustine Eguavoen, who impressed during his short stint in Cameroon. Reflecting on his decision to quit the Red Devils, Peseiro expressed regret over the choice he made, claiming that Porto had pressured him into accepting their offer. “There was great atmosphere during the tournament and brought back beautiful memories, especially in the match between Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia and Al Ahly, which was held at Al Nahyan Stadium,” he told Emirati news outlet Al-Ittihad. “This brings together three clubs I was associated with, as I trained Al-Hilal and Al Ahly, and was the coach of Al Wahda who plays his matches in this stadium. “I should not have left Al Ahly, and if I went back in time I would have stayed. But Porto was putting a lot of pressure on me to come, and Porto is the biggest team in my country. “I agreed, but Porto was not at its best then as it is now, so I should have stayed with Al Ahly.” However, Peseiro has paid tribute to Pitso Mosimane for thriving in his role despite the immense pressure that comes with it. “What Mosimane has achieved with the team is excellent. He has achieved everything, in terms of continental and local titles and won the Club World Cup bronze twice in a row,” the Portuguese tactician added. “Even after losing the league title last season to Zamalek, he is able to win it again. As for the pressure he endures despite his achievements, this is due to the fact that the Al Ahly coach is always under pressure and is always asked to win and achieve the best.”  --AllAfrica--
