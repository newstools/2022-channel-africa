Odinga told the BBC's Sophie Ikenye that he had been a victim of unfair elections in the past and would like a change. He said post election violence was a "consequence of the unfairness in the electoral process" and that if the process was fair it was unlikely there would be violence. Odinga called out his competitor Deputy President, William Ruto, for saying he would set up a parallel tallying centre. "Last elections when we demanded to be allowed to set up a parallel tallying centre he is on record saying it would be unconstitutional now he is saying he wants to set up one so he's basically living in contradictions," Odinga said. --BBC--
