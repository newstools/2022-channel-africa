Hana Kuma, the name of the media company that Osaka has launched in partnership with four-time NBA champion LeBron James, has caused a stir and has been trending on Twitter. The term means “flower bear” in Japanese. But it is not so pleasant in Swahili, it is an explicit phrase referring to an absence of female genitalia. On Twitter, Victoria Uwonkunda has noted the "whole other spicy meaning of the company's name in Swahili": The Kenyan television station, Citizen, has written about the topic and why Kenyans are "all losing their heads over it". The production company has said it will be creating stories that are "culturally specific but universal to all audiences" and aims to “tackle important issues of society”. It already has multiple projects lined up. --BBC--
