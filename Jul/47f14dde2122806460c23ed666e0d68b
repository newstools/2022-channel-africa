“Women constitute more than 50% of Africa's population and therefore it’s important to involve them in development projects,” said Jubel Zulu, one of the leaders of the organisation. Zulu was speaking on the sideline of the African Union Summit which is taking place in Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, under the following theme: Strengthening Resilience in Nutrition and Food Security on the African Continent. 

A member of the opposition Democratic Party, Grace Phiri said it would not be easy for patriarchal African societies to involve women in key decision-making positions. --Channel Africa--
