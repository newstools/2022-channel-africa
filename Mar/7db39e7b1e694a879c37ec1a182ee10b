Charles Murito, Google Director for Government Relations and Public Affairs elaborates on how critical the report is to Africa’s digital transformation. According to the report, demand for African developers reached a record high in 2021 against the global economic crisis and the impact of the pandemic. Small and medium businesses on the continent have increased their internet use by 22% and further increased the need for web development services alongside higher demand for remote development work by 38% of African developers working for at least one company based outside of the continent. He further states that the government has a critical role in enabling an environment for the private sector to influence a positive impact on Africa’s economy and sustain the industry’s strategic economic pillar. Google aims to train 100 000 developers across the continent by 2022 while tackling the gender gap faced through numerous initiatives such as developer advocacy, startup acceleration, training programmes, and global technical mentorship. Murito explains how Google supports women in tech through the Women in Tech Conference as well as the Women Techmakers program.  --Nombuyiselo Tango/ChannelAfrica--
