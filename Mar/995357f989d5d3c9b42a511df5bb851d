It's reported that supplier Kojima Industries Corporation suspected it had been hit by a cyber-attack, causing a halt in production. Japanese factories account for about a third of Toyota's production. Its production target for this year is eight-point-five million vehicles and the closure is expected to set this back by about 13 thousand cars.

It's unclear whether the factories would remain closed beyond Tuesday. --BBC--
