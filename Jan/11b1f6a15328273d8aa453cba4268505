“The success of our economic recovery depends to a large measure on our ability to effectively manage Covid-19, as this virus is likely to remain part of our lives for the foreseeable future,” President Cyril Ramaphosa, who heads the ANC, said at a rally in the northern town of Polokwane on Saturday that marked the 110th anniversary of the party’s founding. Africa’s most-industrialised economy contracted the most in at least two decades in 2020 and unemployment surged to a record 35% last year as virus-related lockdowns shuttered businesses, stalled trade, and weighed on tax revenue. The government started offering Covid-19 booster shots in December, even with only about 45% of adults fully vaccinated. The government started paying a temporary social relief grant to jobless people during the pandemic. With the payments due to end in March, ANC ministers and academics have proposed the introduction of a permanent basic income grant in one of the world’s most unequal societies. Saturday’s anniversary event comes at a difficult time for the ANC, which is Africa’s oldest political movement and has ruled since South Africa’s first multi-racial elections in 1994. Its support slipped below 50% for the first time in a municipal vote two months ago, a backlash against what is seen as its slipshod management of towns, high poverty levels, and a lack of jobs.  --Moneyweb--
