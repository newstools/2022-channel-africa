The assurance comes from the National Institute for Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (INGD), which admits that the humanitarian aid provided so far by the Malawian authorities is not enough. INGD points to a joint action plan to resolve the precarious situation in the reception centres including sending a Mozambican brigade to the field. In an interview, INGD spokesperson Nelma de Araujo did not confirm the number of Mozambicans displaced in Malawi, admitting that it could even exceed the 2500 pointed out by several media in recent days. --ChannelAfrica--
