Lee was honoured with the accolade after a dominant 2021 in which she averaged 90.28 with the bat in ODI cricket, including a spectacular series against India in which she scored 288 runs in four innings.  

On the men's side, Joe Root was named Leading Cricketer in the World, just a week after he stepped down as England's Test captain. Root quit last week after five years as England skipper following a dismal run of one win in 17 games. But his impeccable form with the bat in 2021, when he scored 1 708 runs at an average of 61, helped him earn the global award. Root succeeds his own potential successor with the national side, Ben Stokes, who took the honour in 2019 and 2020. Root is the third Englishman to receive the accolade since it was launched in 2003, with Andrew Flintoff the first in 2005. Elsewhere, South Africa's Dane van Niekerk was named as one of the almanack's five Cricketers of the Year.
