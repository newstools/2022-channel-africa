It is now a certainty that the EU will fund the presence of Runda and SADC troops in Mozambique and everything indicates that Nyusi was this evening on his way to Kigali to probably discuss the terms of that support with his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame. Nyusi left Brussels on Wednesday afternoon and the plane carrying him to the Belgian capital was en route to Kigali with arrival expected at midnight local time. No official announcement of Nyusi's visit to Rwanda has been made, but the Flightradar24 portal, which monitors flights around the world, indicated that the plane carrying him to the Belgian capital was on its way to Rwanda. --Mariamo Khumalo/ChannelAfrica--
