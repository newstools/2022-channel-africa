The vaccination will begin this month to respond to the outbreak of the infection in Malawi, Mozambique’s neighbour, Health Minister Armindo Tiago said, as quoted by Daily Newspaper Notícias. “When there is an occurrence of genetically similar cases in a country, the World Health Organisation classifies that fact as having a circulation of that virus variant. If there is the notification of just one case, eventually the recommendation is that it is a public health emergency and the country should take measures to vaccinate its population,” Tiago explained. The provinces of Niassa, Tete, Zambézia, Manica, Cabo Delgado and Nampula will be the first to be covered by the campaign, which provides for the vaccination of at least 2 million children up to five years old between March and April. Data from the Ministry of Health indicates that the provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado have recorded cases of polio, although it is a different variant from the one circulating in Malawi. Mozambique has remained without a record of this infection for 25 years, according to information from the ministry of health. -- Bissau-Jacob Tivane/ChannelAfrica--
