This came up after the President was engaged in an emergency meeting with his cabinet ministers and members of the Economic Management Team (EMT) over the weekend. Salaries of ministers, heads of state enterprises as well as heads of municipal and district assemblies will all be affected. According to reports, discussions are currently ongoing and a final decision would be out by the close of Monday. The move is to protect social interventions such as the School Feeding Programme. According to the sources, critical among the matters under discussion is whether to maintain the 20% cut across the board or increase it. Ransford Gyampo, an associate professor in the political science department of the University of Ghana, had earlier in a letter requested the government to reduce the size of his government and slash appointees’ salaries by 30%. One measure to keep the economy running that the government announced earlier this year is that the treasury will reduce the allocation to metropolitan, municipal and district assemblies for the first quarter of 2022 by roughly 20%. In a tweet over the weekend, Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko, the political strategist called on the communications machinery of the Akufo-Addo administration to be more proactive in publicising government’s measures taken to “deal with the fiscal difficulties”. --AllAfrica--
