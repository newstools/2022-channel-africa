The head of chemical company INEOS announced last Friday a last minute offer of $5.35 billion but a consortium led by LA Dodgers part-owner, Todd Boehly, is considered the preferred bidder. Russian owner Roman Abramovich, now subject to sanctions by the British government, put the West London club up for sale after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We presented them (New York bank Raine) with an offer at the end of last week, we haven’t heard a great deal back from them which is a bit disappointing,” Ratcliffe told the BBC on Wednesday. “I’d say don’t discount our offer, we are very British and we’ve got great intentions for Chelsea,” he added when asked what his message to those overseeing the sale would be. The Daily Telegraph earlier quoted Ineos communications director Tom Crotty saying Raine had ruled out the company’s bid. “We have had an email to say, “forget it, you are not in the process,” he said. “That was from Raine, but we are not giving up because we believe what we have  got is a bid that makes good sense for the club.” Ratcliffe recognised his move had been late but said it had taken time to reach a fully committed decision. --Reuters--
