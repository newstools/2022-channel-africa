As such, Channel Africa joins the SABC and its internal and external stakeholders to take part in continuing the Legacy of Madiba by becoming a helping hand in their spaces and their communities.

The public broadcaster is encouraging Non-Governmental Organisations, individuals and community members to share with us how they have been a helping hand in their spheres while using the #LendaHand on our social media and digital platforms and promoting 67 minutes of Mandela Day.

Meanwhile, South Africa's  Public Works and Infrastructure Minister, Patricia de Lille, who was also close to the late former President, has called on citizens not to take their democracy for granted.

De Lile, also The GOOD Party leader, was speaking in New York City at a film screening of Mandela in America. The late independent film-maker Danny Schechter, produced the film on Madiba's first visit to the United States in February 1990 after his release from prison.

De Lille says  the time has come for leaders to stand up for what is right.

Happy Mandela Day/Month. Do your part. #LendaHand
