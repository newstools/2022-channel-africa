South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, was appointed by the Southern African Development Community to be a facilitator in that country. Ramaphosa has since appointed the former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke to continue with the work. Moleleki says: “On behalf of the people of Lesotho, we are eternally thankful to the succession of leadership in South Africa for coming to our aid to sober us the people of Lesotho when we get into trouble, but the problem is cult in a lot of things including a relative low level of economic development.” “We are hopeful of Basotho’s support” Meanwhile, leader of the new political party in Lesotho ‘Revolution for Prosperity’, Sam Matekane, says he is optimistic that his party will be supported by Basotho. The new party was launched in March. Matekane says he will use his business leadership skills to address the challenges of the economy in that country. He also appealed to Basotho in Lesotho to vote for his party in the upcoming national elections. --SABC--
