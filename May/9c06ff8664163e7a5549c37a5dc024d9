Ukraine and Russia have traditionally met 80% of the world's largest wheat importer's needs, but not since Russia invaded its neighbour last February. Ukraine has offered to transport part of four contracted shipments to Poland by train, which Egypt says would increase shipping costs dramatically. Egypt is buying 500 000 tonnes from India, which has now banned exports except for paid-up contracts. Madbouly's government has made it compulsory for Egyptian farmers to sell their wheat to it. On Wednesday, the United Nations Secretary General warned that the war in Ukraine is increasing the risk of a global food shortage unless Russia releases grain stored in Ukrainian ports for export. --BBC--
