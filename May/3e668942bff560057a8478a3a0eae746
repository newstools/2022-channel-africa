This increase represents a 20.9% positivity rate. The majority of new cases are from Gauteng (36%) followed by KwaZulu-Natal (19%). The institute says due to the ongoing audit exercise by the National Department of Health (NDoH), there may be a backlog of COVID-19 mortality cases reported. ”The NDoH reports 41 deaths, and of these, 12 occurred in the past 24–48 hours. This brings the total fatalities to 100 812 to date,” says the institute in a statement. So far 24 927 476 tests have been conducted in both public and private. --SABC--
