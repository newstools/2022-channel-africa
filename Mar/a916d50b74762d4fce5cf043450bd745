The Sudan People's Liberation Movement in Opposition said the latest armed assault took place on Monday. The party is led by the Vice-President, Riek Machar, who two years ago formed a unity government with his former enemy Salva Kiir. Continued tension between the two men has prevented the implementation of a peace deal aimed at ending a five-year civil war in which 400 000 people died. --BBC--
