The virologist from Cameroon has spent the last two years heading Africa's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. He told the BBC that there was a potential for a resurgence of HIV/Aids in many parts of Africa and that it was still an emergency which deserved the attention it received 20 years ago. He said there was a risk that more recent outbreaks such as Ebola and coronavirus would undermine gains made in the fight against HIV/Aids. --BBC-- Channel Africa wishes you a happy Africa Day. #WeAllAfrica #MyAfrica
