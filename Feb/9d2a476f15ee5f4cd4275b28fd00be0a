The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is set to give a verdict at 1400 GMT over a legal battle Kinshasa launched against Kampala more than two decades ago. In 2005 the ICJ ruled that Uganda had to pay reparations to its vast central African neighbour for invading it in a five-year war that left hundreds of thousands of people dead. Kinshasa is now claiming more than $11 billion for the occupation of its volatile north-eastern Ituri region. At the same time however, the Hague-based court also said in 2005 that Uganda should be compensated after its embassy in Kinshasa was attacked and its diplomats abused. Negotiations on an amount drew to a stalemate and in 2015 Kinshasa asked for the case to go back before the judges. Following further postponements to find a solution, the ICJ also heard four independent experts to advise it on a possible amount. --TheEastAfrican--
