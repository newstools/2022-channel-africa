As crowds strengthen in numbers, locals are showing their support, saying Damiba must remain in power. Since yesterday, hundreds of people took to the streets of Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, to celebrate the coup that led to the overthrow of President Roch Kaboré. Residents have been waving the national flag soon after the coup was announced on state television. Kaboré's popularity had plunged as a result of his government's failure to defeat militant Islamists who have waged a brutal insurgency in the West African state since 2015. He has reportedly been detained by the military, with his party saying that he had survived an assassination attempt. --ChannelAfrica--
