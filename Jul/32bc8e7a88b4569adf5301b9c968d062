Government officials admit that the refinery project has fallen behind others, and will likely come onstream late in 2027 at the earliest if the necessary financing is tied up and the pending technical studies concluded sooner. As a result, local players that were primed to take up equity in the project as well as regional countries that expressed interest in the refinery that was sold as an East African Community venture, remain non-committed, citing the project's failure to take shape since 2018, when it was awarded to a consortium of investors. Potential investors say they remain open to discussions with the government, but without an engineering, procurement and construction structure, the refinery remains an unbankable project. --EastAfrica--
