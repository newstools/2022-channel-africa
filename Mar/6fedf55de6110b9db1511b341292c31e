Maxime Jeoffroy Eli Mokom was the leader of an "anti-Balaka" group and is suspected of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in 2013 and 2014. Violence in CAR started after Muslim rebels known as Seleka seized power in March 2013. Their rule made the Christian rebels to form the opposing anti-Balaka group. Several leaders from both rebel groups were arrested for crimes committed against civilians. The ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the anti-Balaka leader in 2018. Chadian soldiers acted as peacekeepers in CAR after the 2013 violence but withdrew after they were accused of siding with the Muslim rebels. --BBC--
