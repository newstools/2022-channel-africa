This week, the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) released its study Gas Pressure: Exploring the case for gas-fired power in South Africa, which indicates that the development of the gas industry may not be warranted until at least 2035. According to the report, gas would be a too-costly investment and would be as harmful to the climate as coal. Introducing 3 000 megawatt of gas capacity and gas supply by 2030, aligned to the Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) of 2019 would cost at least $4 billion, according to the IISD. As of March 2022, the South Africa government plans at least 14 000 MW of gas to power projects - more than a third (36%) of Eskom's coal fleet. --News24--
