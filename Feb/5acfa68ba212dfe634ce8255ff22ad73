The introduction of the K5000 ($282.10) banknote has cost taxpayers $34.4 million, including introduction of new features on the K2000 ($112.84)  banknote. But some Malawians think the currency lost value and, as such, introducing a high value banknote will help the Central Bank to preserve one characteristic of money, which is portability and reduce the cost of printing banknotes. “According to currency management policies, the high banknote in the economy should not account for more than 60% of the total value of currency in circulation. As it stands, the old K2000 ($112.84) banknote has exceeded over 80% in currency circulation hence the need to introduce a higher banknote. Buyers will now need one K5000 note to settle a K4000 ($225.68) bill instead of requiring two K2000 ($112.84) banknotes. Portability was also considered as we all know that currency has to be easily and economically carried from one place to another. “Lastly the enormous pressure on demand for K2000($112,84)  signifies that the banknote is being used for transaction purposes instead of being a store of value as should be the case for higher denominations. “This therefore, calls for a higher denomination banknote to act as a store of value,” explained Banda. Banda also highlighted the reasons behind the introduction of the upgraded 2000 Kwacha ($112.84)  banknote and this include, making K2000 ($112.84)  banknote more secure by including modern security features and the replacement of the image of the Malawi University of Science and Technology at the back of the note with an image of Blantyre Magistrate Court which represent the urgent need for the country to fight corruption. --ChannelAfrica/Malawi24--
