Jeffrey Moyo, a 37-year-old Zimbabwean, spent three weeks in jail last year for obtaining fake accreditation documents for two of the United States newspaper's journalists on a visit. The New York Times said the charges were baseless and that a Zimbabwe Media Commission official had issued him papers for Christina Goldbaum and Joao Silva. They were expelled. "It was a nasty experience, sleeping on the concrete floor and having no contact with my family," Moyo told Reuters. "It was terrible, but I'm optimistic that things will go well." Officials were not immediately available to comment on the trial due to take place at a court in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second biggest city. But a Spokesperson last year accused Moyo of paying a bribe to break immigration laws. --Reuters--
