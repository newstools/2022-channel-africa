Bureaux de change, according to the argument should be left to freely operate in line with the government’s focus to stimulate economic growth after the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The BoT decision will ultimately support the government’s tourist’s attraction through the Royal Tour Documentary that has featured President Samia Suluhu Hassan as the main character. Debating the budget in Dodoma last week, Arusha Urban legislator Mrisho Gambo said eligible licence applicants for the bureau de change business as well as those wishing to revive their businesses should be given green light in order to stimulate the country’s economy. “The number of tourists is increasing in different parts of the country, particularly Arusha Region. Most hotels are fully booked until December this year,” he said. “This required enough and reliable bureaux de change in order to reduce or eliminate possible inconveniences to visitors,” he added. He blamed the BoT for ignoring the government directives and of double standard that has seen applications from different eligible players being turned down. Gambo said tabling the national budget, the Finance and Planning minister underscored the importance of the business in the country’s economy, hinting, however, that Kadoo Bureau De Change was the only private company currently doing the business in the country. --TheCitizen--
