Vehicle dealerships for all vehicle brands have already been experiencing stock issues because of the global semiconductor shortage resulting from a fire at a major semiconductor supplier last year and global supply chain disruptions caused by Covid-19 lockdowns. The suspension of production by TSAM, if it continues for an extended period, is likely to exacerbate any vehicle stock shortages in Toyota’s dealer network. TSAM spokespersons were unable to indicate when production will resume or quantify the damage caused to the plant. They were also unable to immediately confirm how many vehicles are produced on a daily or weekly basis at the plant. Toyota is the market leader in vehicle sales in South Africa. The plant produces the Toyota Hilux, Sesfikile taxi vehicle, Corolla Cross, Quest and Fortuner. The floods have also negatively impacted automotive component suppliers to TSAM and other original equipment manufacturers. National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers Executive Director Renai Moothilal confirmed on Wednesday that automotive component suppliers had been impacted by the floods but was unable to provide the names of affected companies. Moothilal said several suppliers have had to shut down. Motor Industry Staff Association Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Martlé Keyter said the association is devastated by the impact the floods in Durban and the surrounding areas will have on the retail motor industry, which is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. National Automobile Dealers’ Association Director Gary McCraw said there has not been any official notification from Toyota other than the company’s brief comment and there are few facts about the situation. --Moneyweb--
