“The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine stands breached. The charter of the UN continues to wilt under the relentless assault of the powerful," Martin Kimani said. His statement, which has been mostly welcomed on Twitter, drew comparisons between Africa’s experience of colonialism and the Russia-Ukraine crisis. “We understand that separated people may look yearningly across borders hoping for reintegration, but Kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force," he said. Kimani's comments signal a marked change from Kenya's previous position at the UN Security Council, when it abstained from voting. Gabon and Ghana, which are also non-permanent members of the body, also condemned Russia’s actions against Ukraine. There are concerns that the cost of living could rise as a result of the crisis. Kenya’s Business Daily Newspaper on Tuesday published a front-page headline: “How Russia-Ukraine row will hurt Kenyan homes”. “Disruptions from any military action or sanctions could also see bread and wheat flour prices rally in Kenya, which relies on imported wheat from Ukraine and Russia,” the report said. An article in South Africa’s Daily Maverick news site warned that a war in eastern Europe “will soon ripple and be felt in every village and town of South Africa and the world”. Mali, whose growing alliance with Russia has worsened a diplomatic fallout with Western partners, is yet to officially comment on the imminent conflict. --BBC--
