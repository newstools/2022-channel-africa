Officials say two patients in the southern Ashanti region died in hospital after contracting the highly infectious haemorrhagic fever, which has similarities to Ebola. Bats are a known source of transmission. Officials are warning people to keep away from caves. It's only the second outbreak of the Marburg virus in West Africa, after a single case in Guinea last year.
