The Kenyan registered 10.14 seconds in the heat, missing out on the two automatic and the two non-automatic qualifying spots for the final. The 26-year-old arrived in Oregon just three hours before his race on Saturday, July 16. He had less than 24 hours to recover for the semifinals after his Visa was delayed. After his exit from the competition he took to Twitter, tweeting:  "Every challenge you face today makes you stronger tomorrow. The challenge of life is intended to make you better, not bitter. “Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work through difficult problems. No matter how much falls on us, we keep moving."
