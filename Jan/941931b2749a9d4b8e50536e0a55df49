One of Sudan's leading protest organisers rejected the UN's call for dialogue, amid renewed protests for the return to civilian rule. The UN's offer to mediate came a week after the resignation of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who said his decision was based on the inability of the generals to compromise with the protesters. The Sudanese Professionals' Association said in a statement that the "only way" out of the crisis was through the removal of the generals from the seat of power. The protest movement wants civilian leadership restored, underscored by the protest slogan, "no negotiations, no compromise, no power sharing." --AllAfrica--
