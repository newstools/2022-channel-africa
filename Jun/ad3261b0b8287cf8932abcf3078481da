Opening the ministerial conference, Okonjo-Iweala called on member-states to invest in WTO so that it can respond to people's aspirations. She said the organisation is worth investing in. “That is why I came here. It is worth strengthening. The multilateral trading system is a global public good”, Okonjo-Iweala said. She stressed that though certainly not perfect, by historical standards, WTO has delivered more prosperity to more people than any international economic order that came before it. “Today, with history looming over us, with that multilateral system seemingly fragile, this is the time to invest in it, not to retreat from it”, she said. --SABC--
