The pilfered crude is turned into gasoline, diesel and kerosene in makeshift refineries that have proliferated in the cover provided by the creeks and forests of the Niger Delta region. 

“It is sabotage to the nation’s economy and very dangerous to the health of the people,” Nyesom Wike, the Governor of Rivers state, said in an interview. “We cannot sit down and see our people dying with all kinds of ailments,” he said in Port Harcourt, the state capital. Africa’s biggest oil producer loses as many as 150 000 barrels of crude per day to criminals that tap into the pipelines crisscrossing Rivers and other southern states, the government estimates, with much of the haul ending up at the informal refineries. 

At current prices, the missing barrels are worth almost $6.8 billion a year. Some industry figures say the scale of the stealing is even worse. Theft has contributed to “abysmally low” oil production, Nigerian Chief of Defence Staff Lucky Irabor said on February 19. 

The country, with a capacity of 2.5 million barrels a day, only produced about 1.5 million barrels a day of crude equivalent in December, down from around 1.7 million barrels at the start of 2021, according to government data. 

Despite a modest improvement in January, performance remains below the quota set by OPEC+ for Nigeria. Oil theft both erodes current output and discourages investment in future production.
