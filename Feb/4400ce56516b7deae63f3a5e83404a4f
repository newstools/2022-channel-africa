Meyer notes that the main issue to make the Budget Speech insignificant is fact that the South African government has already collected approximately $14 billion (R200 billion) additional income in the last tax budget year. He says the question would be how government will use that once-off income received in the past few years. However, with unemployment having been the main factor that has had citizens doubting its government, Meyer the expectation is that the budget will focus more on development and allocating more money to developing various areas of society and the economy. “More money should go into infrastructure. Through those projects, they will have mega infrastructure plans, hopefully they can use the private sector to create jobs. Also, they need to concentrate on social welfare.” The Professor further hopes the government wage bill, already at 35% of the total budget, won’t increase in percentage of the total budget. He hopes for personal tax and the Value Added Tax will not to be increased. “In actual fact, people will pay less tax per month that means there is more money in the public pocket for spending, and consumption will drive the economy also in a much better direction.” In an exclusive interview with Channel Africa, Meyer says more of the budget will be allocated to developmental activities than it was in the past. He highlights that it is also important for the government to support small businesses, tourism and all the basic economic growth aspects. “No more bailout for the State-Owned Enterprises because that is just money going into a big black hole.” Additionally, Meyer hopes government could also look at cutting tax on the fuel prices.
