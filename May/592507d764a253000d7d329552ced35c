The Elders are an international non-governmental organisation founded in 2007 by former President Nelson Mandela, made up of public figures such as peace activists, senior statesmen, as well as human rights advocates who offer collective experience to promote peace. Russian forces already held the rest of the city, where an estimated 100 000 people remain out of a pre-war population of 450 000, many of them trapped during the siege with little food, water, heat or electricity. At least 21 000 people were killed in the siege, according to Ukrainian authorities, who have accused Russia of trying to cover up the horrors by bringing in mobile cremation equipment and by burying the dead in mass graves. Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of waging “total war” and seeking to inflict as much death and destruction as possible on his country. “Indeed, there has not been such a war on the European continent for 77 years,” Zelensky said, referring to the end of World War II. The war in Ukraine has led to food shortages, especially in Africa, as the two countries are exporters of wheat and cooking oil. The Elders’ Deputy Chair and former South African first lady, Graça Machel, says all efforts should go into ending the conflict. --SABC--
