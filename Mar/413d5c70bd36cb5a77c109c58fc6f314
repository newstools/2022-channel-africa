Global sales rose 5% to $10.9 billion for the third quarter ended February 28, beating Wall Street’s estimates. Revenue outpaced expectations in all regions, including Greater China, where sales fell less than predicted. It maintained its full-year outlook of revenue growth in the mid-single digits. The shares rose 6% in after-market trading at 6:03 PM in New York on Monday. The stock had fallen 22% this year through the close. Direct-to-consumer sales have been the focus for Nike under Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe, who has pulled the brand back from many wholesale partners in favor of its own website. 

Revenue in its direct business grew 17%, excluding currency swings, to $4.6 billion and accounted for about 42% of total sales. Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said Nike is “now moving into the next phase” of that strategy, having cut wholesale accounts worldwide by over 50%. 

Nike will now invest in the stores that it decided to remain in and work on more of its own retail concepts. 

Management called out Foot Locker Inc as an important partner, sending the sneaker chain’s shares up as much as 5.3%. The retailer had been hit hard by Nike’s revamped strategy.
