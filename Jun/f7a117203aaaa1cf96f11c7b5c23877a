This, after the official handover of Part Five of the State Capture report was delayed twice. Ramaphosa says he had a telephonic conversation with Chief Justice and Commission Chairperson, Raymond Zondo in which Zondo gave reassurance that the report would be delivered. The Commission's team had allegedly informed the Presidency that the report would be finalised after the sitting of the JSC on Monday, but not in time for the evening deadline. The report is now expected to be handed over to the President on Wednesday.  --SABC--
