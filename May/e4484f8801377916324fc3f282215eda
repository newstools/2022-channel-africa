In the wake of a landmark Dutch ruling a year ago which ordered Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030, a German organic cattle-and-grain farmer is targeting Volkswagen AG to force it to reduce its output of polluting cars to zero by that same date. Ulf Allhoff-Cramer is one of several Germans who, with the help of environmental groups, are suing big corporations to pressure them to bring their businesses in line with ambitious climate-change targets. His case, which will be heard at a court on Friday in the central German city of Detmold, is a litmus test for a wave of climate change-related litigation pending in German courts. “As the second-largest car manufacturer in the world, VW really bears a huge responsibility for the global climate,” the farmer says in a Youtube video produced as part of the campaign. “Something has to change fundamentally and it’s therefore necessary to send a signal with such a lawsuit.” Greenpeace is funding Allhoff-Cramer’s case and another suit by three plaintiffs in a Braunschweig tribunal. Deutsche Umwelthilfe is sponsoring similar litigation against BMW AG, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and oil and gas producer Wintershall DEA. --Moneyweb--
