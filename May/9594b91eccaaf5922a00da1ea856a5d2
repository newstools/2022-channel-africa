The decision, announced by Nigeria's ministry of youth and sports and approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, means Atosu and her team-mates will miss September's Women's World Cup in Australia. A letter from the ministry said the withdrawal was because of "the unending drama that have plagued and nearly crippled basketball" in the West African country. "This will enable Nigeria to revamp the sports from the grassroots as well as domestic leagues which have become moribund," the letter added. The Nigerian Basketball Federation (NBBF) is to be dissolved and an interim committee appointed to oversee the management of the game in the country. "Sport is not a puzzle that you have to crush what's working to fix what's not working," Atosu, who helped Nigeria win the 2017 African title, posted on Twitter. "This isn't the best route." She added on Facebook: "I have so much to say yet it breaks my heart to see Nigerian basketball in the mud. This game has been a blessing to many people, remember that our leaders." BBC Sport Africa understands the decision was taken to avert an agreement by both Nigeria's men's and women's teams to stage a protest at international tournaments. Ministry officials are also disappointed that players have chosen to support one faction in the federation's ongoing the leadership crisis. Under the rules of the sport's world governing body, Fiba, interference by government into the running of national teams and the sport is strictly forbidden. The stance by the government could lead to Fiba banning Nigeria from global basketball which would mean their national sides, club teams and officials excluded from all international competitions and meetings. Fiba has been contacted for comment. --BBC--
