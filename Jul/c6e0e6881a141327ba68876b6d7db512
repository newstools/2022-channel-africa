The pact between the ruling National Resistance Movement party and the Democratic Party was signed on Wednesday following a meeting between the two leaders at State House, Entebbe city in Central Uganda. Museveni praised leaders of Democratic Party for the "gesture of mature, foresighted, and constructive politics". Mao has been leader of the opposition party since 2010. He stood out for his eloquence and anti-establishment stance, but the party has suffered internal divisions for several years which have led to a significant drop in public appeal. Ahead of the 2021 general election, he lost several party leaders to the newly formed National Unity Platform. Mao’s backers will see this development as smart bipartisanship, but critics will feel vindicated after accusing him of cosying up to Museveni. --BBC--
