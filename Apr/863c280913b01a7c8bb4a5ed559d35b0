In a tweet, Operation Dudula leader Nhlanhla Lux Dlamini said: "We just got shot at with AK47s and R5s in Soweto! Zimbabweans and Sotho Nationals opened fire in a South African community crowd that was attending to cable theft. My guys got hit." In another tweet, with a photograph of one of his colleagues showing a gunshot wound, Dlamini said: "We were ambushed by illegal foreigners with rifles! one of our guys died on the spot; we are waiting for hospitals to update us on the five South African women who got shot from the back. Question for illegal foreigners and South African politicians; are u sure about this route you are taking?" Police were unavailable for comment. Reacting to Dlamini's tweet, Zimbabwean, Takunda, said, "You need to stop illegal operations and exposing South African citizens to this sort of danger. Residents documented or undocumented have a right to protect themselves from dangers coming from your operation. Stop it before this gets out of control."
