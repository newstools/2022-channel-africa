The airline, in which the government has a 48.9% stake, saw revenue plunge by half at the height of the pandemic in 2020, as carriers around the world were forced to ground their planes. "We have been through the worst patch," Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Allan Kilavuka, said in an interview, noting passenger revenue had grown 21% in 2021 as a recovery started. That helped the airline's loss narrow by a fifth during the first half of last year, but it still lost $101 million during the six months. Kenya Airways had slipped into insolvency long before the pandemic, mainly due to an expansion drive that saddled it with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to finance the purchase of new planes, followed by travel warnings in 2013 due to insecurity in the country. Aviation consultant Seabury was hired last month to advise on returning to profitability and its report is expected in the next three weeks, Kilavuka said. "We are looking for a more efficient airline. The network should not lose money." Forward bookings for the peak summer travel season were promising, he said, adding the airline was hoping an election in Kenya scheduled for August 9 would not cause disruption. Two out of the last three elections in Kenya saw significant violence, hurting the travel industry and the wider economy. This year's Kenya Airways growth forecast is dependent on no further travel disruption or restrictions caused by any new coronavirus variants, the CEO said. --Reuters--
