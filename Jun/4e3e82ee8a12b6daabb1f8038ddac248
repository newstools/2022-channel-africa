Kotoko clinched the 2021-22 Ghanaian Premier League title this past weekend, their first full championship since 2014 and a 24th overall. The two-time CAF Champions League winners (1970 and 1983) have not reached the group stage of the competition since 2006. They competed in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 editions of the CAFCL as winners of the Ghana Normalisation Tier 1 league, but were eliminated in the last 32 (First Round) preliminary phase on both occasions. Awuku, the National Organiser of Ghana’s ruling New Patriotic Party, says the government will ensure that the Porcupine Warriors have all the assistance they will need to compete strongly in the top-tier continental tournament. “I believe that in terms of tactical discipline, it’s been good, their scoring ability is what they should work on,” Awuku told Akoma FM, as quoted by Football Ghana. “You cannot waste such opportunities in Africa. But their overall game plan looks very fantastic. “Government will do its part, same as the NLA [National Lottery Authority] and also the Ministry of Youth and Sports to raise funds for Kotoko to do well in Africa.”  --AllAfrica--
