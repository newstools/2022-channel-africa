They qualified for their second successive appearance at a FIFA Women’s World Cup and will be going to Australia and New Zealand next year. They beat Tunisia one-nil in the quarter-final of the tournament in a tough battle in Rabat on Thursday evening. They will join hosts Morocco, Zambia and Nigeria at the global showpiece. Banyana Banyana continued their consistency in the tournament with another win. It’s a team that has maintained its momentum over the years and has now secured another appearance at the World Cup next year. The players displayed character and stood their ground despite disruptions that included the injury of star player Thembi Kgatlana and positive COVID-19 cases. It was a massive test and despite all the concerns they kept their promise to give their all. Banyana Banyana broke the deadlock as early as the 14th minute through Jermaine Seoposenwe. More scoring opportunities were created by Banyana Banyana in both halves but they failed to convert. Although they had periods of dominance, they also allowed Tunisia to threaten.  They were fortunate late in the game not concede, with the North African being denied two close penalty calls. Banyana, who managed to protect the solitary goal for almost 70 minutes, will return to the drawing board with some aspects of the game especially on attack that needs special attention. There were celebratory and emotional scenes in the Banyana Banyana camp. While celebrations continue, Banyana will immediately regroup and prepare to face Zambia in the semi-finals to keep their hopes of winning the tournament alive. --SABC-- WE HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE 2023 FIFA WOMEN'S WORLD CUP!!!!ðºðºð¥ð¥ @Banyana_Banyanað¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ð¿ð¦ Give coach Desiree Ellis her flowers man, what she has done with Banyana Banyana is brilliant ð¿ð¦ð¥love to see it ❤️ Back to the #FIFAWWC! ð¿ð¦South Africa has qualified to their second consecutive tournament!
