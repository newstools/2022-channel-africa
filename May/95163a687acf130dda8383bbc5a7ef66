Limpopo police Spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said during the anti-crime blitz, conducted mainly by female law enforcement officers, five suspects were also arrested for rape and two for attempted rape. “In a joint effort to deal with cross border crimes such as smuggling of stolen motor vehicles, stock theft, illicit cigarettes, drugs and other serious crimes, the provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, led the joint cross-border Operation Basadi comprising different law enforcement officers in Limpopo Province, predominantly women and their Zimbabwean counterparts, supported by members of the South African National Defence Force,” said Mojapelo. “The joint operations were conducted on both sides of the border around Beitbridge and Musina over the weekend. Other stakeholders involved included home affairs, customs, traffic, bargaining council and the Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism.” “Some of the areas that were targeted for the operations have in the recent past, been used by smugglers who took advantage of certain sections of the Limpopo River where water levels were low, to smuggle goods such as stolen motor vehicles across the border,” said Mojapelo. “Several stolen motor vehicles have, in the past, been intercepted by members of the South African National Defence Force on the verge of being smuggled across the Limpopo River into Zimbabwe. One of the vehicles, a Ford Ranger, is still stuck in the river and will be retrieved once water levels subside.” --IOL--
