Serbia's Djokovic dropped just four games as he cruised to a 6-3 6-1 6-0 victory on Court Philippe Chatrier. Djokovic was making his return to Grand Slam action after his high-profile deportation from Australia before the Australian Open in January. Earlier, 13-time champion Rafael Nadal beat Jordan Thompson 6-2 6-2 6-2. Djokovic was unable to defend his Australian Open title after being deported from the country over his Covid-19 vaccination status and risked being frozen out of Roland Garros until France lifted restrictions in almost all public spaces in March. The 20-time Grand Slam champion has had mixed fortunes on the court this season with shock defeats in Monte Carlo and Belgrade before regrouping to capture his first title in six months without dropping a set at last week's Italian Open. Djokovic, who could face Nadal in the quarter-finals as he looks to equal the Spaniard's record haul of 21 major titles, continued the form he showed in Rome, despatching Nishioka in just under two hours. After a low-key opening set, the two-time champion stepped up the intensity in the second, dropping just one game as he broke Nishioka's serve in four games, with Djokovic's clear dominance prompting jeers from sections of the crowd at times. Djokovic, who turned 35 on Sunday, strolled to victory in the third set to improve his record in first-round matches at Roland Garros to 18-0 after converting eight of 18 break points He will next meet either Argentina's Federico Coria or Slovakia's Alex Molcan, who is coached by Djokovic's former long-time coach Marian Vajda. "I have to be pleased with the match," Djokovic said. "I struggled to adapt in the first set. He is a very quick player. The first set was close but I cruised through the second and third. "I always expect the highest for myself but it was a very good start. "I have been feeling well on clay in the past few weeks. I am happy to be back. The memories from last year are fresh in my mind." --BBC--
