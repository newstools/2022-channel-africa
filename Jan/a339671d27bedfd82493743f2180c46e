Immunisations of 12-18 year olds begun in the middle of last year around the world and now Israel, the United States and Germany have recommended booster shots for the age group. Speaking at the weekly briefing in Geneva, Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan says there is no evidence that healthy children need the extra protection. She says while there is evidence of waning immunity over time against the Omicron variant, more research needs to be done before boosters can be approved for the pre-teen and teenage grouping. “There is no evidence right now that healthy children or healthy adolescents need boosters, no evidence at all. “So, this is why the SAGE which is our technical expert body that makes policy recommendations has been meeting and will continue to meet”, said Swaminathan. SAGE will meet later this week to consider the specific question of how should countries think about giving boosters to their population, with a view to protecting people and reducing deaths.  --SABC--
