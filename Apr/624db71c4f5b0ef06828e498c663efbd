This is according to the African Rail Industry Association (Aria). Aria says the decision, which will promote the increased use of rail for the transportation of freight – will unlock significant benefits for the broader economy and stimulate the country’s job creation efforts. James Holley, Chief Executive Officer of private pan-African rail operator Traxtion, says the South African government’s decision to proceed with its long-mooted plans has already created a “storm of interest” from international locomotive and rolling stock manufacturers and investors. He says this interest will be further increased by the recent signing of the Luxembourg Rail Protocol by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, a move which is set to provide private finance for rolling stock as well as flexible rolling stock procurement strategies. “The freight rail sector is a key enabler of the economy, and by providing the confidence that investors need, we’re going to see significant inflows into the rail sector, but perhaps more importantly, the upstream economy,” says Holley. --Moneyweb--
