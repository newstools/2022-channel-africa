The cosmetics giant, owned by billionaire Ron Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes, sought court protection in the Southern District of New York late Tuesday. It listed assets totalling $2.3 billion as of late April, and debts of $3.7 billion, according to court papers. Chapter 11 filings allow a company to continue operating while it works out a plan to repay creditors. Revlon said in a statement that its lined up $575 million of so-called debtor-in-possession financing from existing lenders to fund itself during bankruptcy. Known for its nail polishes and lipsticks, the 90-year-old company in recent years has lost shelf space and sales to start-ups backed by celebrities such as Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics and Rihanna's Fenty Beauty. In its bankruptcy filing, Revlon says supply chain disruptions prompted intense competition for ingredients used to make its products. At the same time, vendors that traditionally offered up to 75 days for payment began demanding cash in advance of new orders, while labour shortages and inflation added to its troubles.  --Reuters--
