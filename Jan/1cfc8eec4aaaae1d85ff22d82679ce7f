The world champions beat South Africa by one solitary goal 51– 50 to finish third in the four nation tournament. The Proteas and Silver Ferns met for the second time in 24 hours and this time around it was for the bronze medal. South Africa finished the stronger side of the two yesterday and today they started as they ended. It was the Proteas that took an early lead in the game, they led the quarter for the most part and from there it was pound for pound right until the last second when New Zealand finished the quarter 14 -13. Monique Reyneke limped off the court and was replaced by Khanyisa Chawane. Simone Rabie came in at Goal Defence for Nicola Smith and this was her first in this tournament. The Proteas were more clinical today and played with a lot of confidence and took the game to New Zealand, they fought harder today and ended the quarter trailing by three points. --IOL Sport--
