The animals were in Tsavo National Park, one of the country’s oldest parks. It is also one of the world’s largest wildlife reserves. The Kenyan authorities fear the ecosystem will experience more wildlife deaths if the drought continues. A number of giraffes have also died, said Balala. "We have an abundance of wildlife but still every animal counts and we care if one goes down," he added. The Kenyan government is aiming to use an old dam to create water pans in the area to prevent further wildlife deaths. The drought in East Africa has also affected millions of people in several countries leaving many at risk of severe food shortages. --BBC--
