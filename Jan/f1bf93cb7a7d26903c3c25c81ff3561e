The President announced in a statement that the minimum monthly wage would be $171.5, an increase of 12.5% from the current $152.5. Civil servants' salaries are also expected to increase by about 13%. This is the third time al-Sissi has raised the minimum wage since taking office in 2014. The announcement came after a meeting with financial officials to discuss the upcoming budget. Bonuses for teachers were also announced. The statement did not specify when the increases would be implemented, but they are expected by the start of the new fiscal year in July. The austerity measures were part of an ambitious economic reform programme designed to revive Egypt's economy, battered by years of political unrest and violence after the 2011 uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak. The reforms were agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in exchange for a $12 billion loan, which the Egyptian government secured in 2016. They included the floating of the currency, substantial cuts in government subsidies for basic goods and the introduction of a wide range of new taxes. --AfricaNews--
