“It is with a lot of mixed emotions that I announce my retirement from international cricket. From a very young age, I have lived cricket and wanted to represent my country at the highest level," Lee said in a statement. " Over the past 8 years I was able to live that dream and I feel I have given everything I could to the Proteas.” Lee, whose wife Tanya gave birth to a baby boy earlier this year, said she would focus on playing in domestic T20 tournaments around the world. “My fellow Proteas teammates, thank you for the wonderful memories we have made together. You  have made this journey incredible, and I could not have done this without you.” Lee played 100 ODIs, having made her debut in 2013. She scored 3315 runs at an average of 36.42, making three hundreds and 23 fifties. In 82 T20 Internationals, she scored 1896 runs with a strike rate of 110.61. She also played two Tests. "Lizelle has given this country countess moments on the field of play, most Kota leaders in 2021 when she was leading from the front with the bat  and was named ICC Women's ODI Player of the Year," said CSA’S new Director of Cricket, Enoch Nkwe. Lee's retirement is a big blow coming on the eve of a three match ODI series with England and just weeks before the Commonwealth Games, where the Proteas are one of eight participants in a T20 competition. --IOL--
