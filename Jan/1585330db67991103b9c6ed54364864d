According to The East African newspaper, the country’s Health Minister, Jane Ruth Aceng, said the vaccines had been supplied to the northern regions but were not used. The expired doses are mainly Moderna with some AstraZeneca doses also set to be destroyed. Aceng has been at the forefront in urging Ugandans to take the COVID-19 vaccines. The Ugandan government mandated vaccinations among essential workers, including teachers. This was aimed at boosting the public’s protection against adverse effects of the disease. So far, Uganda has reported 156 637 cases of COVID-19 with 3 378 fatalities. Its vaccination drive has already seen some 12 220 106 doses administered across the country. --Africa.cgtn.com--
