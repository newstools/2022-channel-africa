Very little is known about the content of the sale agreement and stakeholders are now taking steps to ensure proper disclosure. Government announced at the end of February that the deal with Takatso had been signed pending regulatory approval. Most commentators took this as a reference to the Competition Commission but the deal also requires the green light from the domestic and international air licensing councils, according to transport economist Joachim Vermooten. South Africa’s International Air Licensing Council must approve cross-border routes for local airlines. Its Domestic Air Licensing Council has oversight over compliance with the 25% foreign shareholding limit and the sustainability of the business plans of local commercial airlines. It must also, among other things, ensure that the airlines have sufficient provision to secure the deposits of flight tickets sold in advance, proper insurance, and the required safety and technical approvals from the Civil Aviation Authority. --Moneyweb--
