This follows Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok’s resignation, more than a week ago. Reports from Sudan’s capital Khartoum say, resistance groups have been formed throughout the country to push for the handing of power from the military Generals to civilians as per August 2019 agreement, which paved the way for the establishment of a government that was led by military and civilian men and women. With the situation remaining unpredictable, Sudanese political and military experts have been expressed mixed comments on what lies ahead in the north-eastern Africa country. Experts, Hafez Kabir says: “Sudan will go for a new crisis because there are many military groups. There are many political forces, their opinion is not the same and there are many problems], also in economic side, social side. The people of Sudan want a new initiative solution that can save the situation in Sudan. The transition in Sudan is very difficult. The military structure that [toppled President El Bashir  left, means that (the current) structure is strong and therefore or Sudan to move forward, a lot of work must be done to delink politics from the military, which is a long, long process that will take so many years. This implies that any support that the military has been having through the good international standing of, resigned Prime Minister Hamdok, is going to fizzle out, said expert diplomacy and international relations, Kizito Sabala. --ChannelAfrica--
