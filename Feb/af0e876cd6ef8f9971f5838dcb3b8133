Khalid Omer Yousif and Wagdi Salih, another top official in the former administration, were arrested on Wednesday, according to their Forces of Freedom and Change coalition. Yousif was arrested at his party headquarters and taken to a police station in the capital Khartoum, the Reuters news agency reports. Salih tweeted that he was taken to the same station and then to Omdurman prison and was under investigation regarding a charge of "breach of trust". The two had previously been involved in a task force that seized property and fired bureaucrats linked to the regime of Omar al-Bashir, who fell to a popular uprising in 2019. There have been arbitrary arrests in Sudan since last year's coup. Security forces have also violently dispersed pro-democracy protests in different instances leading to deaths. The military leaders last year seized power and arrested the civilian prime minister just a month before Sudan was scheduled to transition to a civilian head of state. --BBC--
