Through the initiative, they are reaching out to affected households with relief and rehabilitation items. The Bushiris say the complete package entails not just helping the households with relief items, but also supporting them with capacity to help them repair and rebuild their homes when the ground gets dry. The couple escaped bail conditions in South Africa and fled to Malawi. They have now decided to embark on the distribution of relief and rehabilitation items at a time when 32 people have died and thousands others displaced due to cyclone Ana last week. The Cyclone also brought about impassable roads and bridges, roofs of some schools and houses being blown off and power blackouts because the main hydro power Station Kapichira had its dam and dyke damaged. Looking at how grave the situation is, especially in the Southern Region districts which border Malawi and Mozambique, the Bushiris want affected families to live a normal life hence the exercise. According to Bushiri, the first phase of their initiative involves providing food relief items to households affected by disasters before embarking on the rehabilitation of houses with materials. This Friday, they are in Phalombe and Thyolo Districts close to the Western part of Mozambique where over 5000 households were also affected after being in Mulanje where over 18 000 households are destitute. The family’s court issue brought about a diplomatic row between South Africa and Malawi last year following their escape. How they arrived in Malawi remains questionable globally.  --George Mhango/ChannelAfrica--
