According to the central bank, Tanzania’s national debt stock swelled by $5.3 billion, reaching $35.76 billion in the year to October 31, 2021. Luoga, who was speaking in a Clouds Radio broadcast, said Tanzania can borrow up to 70% of its GDP, while it only reached 27.9% in 2020. “So far, Tanzania has not touched the threshold of debt distress. We are still in the green,” said Luoga. He said a sustainability study was carried out in November and while results are not yet out, he expected the debt not to have exceeded 28.5%b of GDP. “This means that we have not reached even half of the 70% threshold,” Luoga told the station. The governor noted that Tanzania ranked 109th out of 170 among highly indebted countries globally. “We are not borrowing for food but we are doing so for projects that will continue to produce; and because they continue to produce means our debt resilience will continue to be better as income increases,” he said. The debate began on December 28 following comments from Tanzania Speaker of the National Assembly Job Ndugai, who expressed worries about the borrowing trend under President Samia Suluhu Hassan. He suggested that the country should rely on internal revenue collections, like the mobile money levies introduced this year, to finance development projects. “Is there any pride in taking around a beggar’s bowl? When we borrow we applaud. We have resorted to borrowing every day. There will come a day when this country will be sold off and people will continue to be happy instead of being sad,” Ndugai said. The Tanzania Coalition on Debt and Development urged the government to empower Parliament to decide on which loans will be accepted and which will be rejected, hence improving on transparency and accountability in debt contracting. --TheEastAfrican--
