The partnership between the two entities will, among other things, share experiences of mutual benefit in the petroleum downstream industry especially in the management of the Unified Petroleum Price Fund (UPPF) which ensures that prices of petroleum products are the same across the country. The team were here to also understudy Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) regulation in Ghana. Welcoming the delegation, the NPA Boss said he was elated to have such a delegation to study the downstream regulations of LPG. “It is important that Africans go to each other for solutions to Africa Problems rather than travel abroad to seek solutions which are not feasible,” Dr Abdul-Hamid added. On his part, the Petroleum Fund Chief Executive Officer of Lesotho, said he was happy for the warm welcome and that they were in anticipation to learn the successes of the NPA’s Unified Petroleum Price Fund and “the ground breaking role the downstream sector of Ghana has achieved in regulating LPG.” The four-member team from Lesotho also included Mohloko Lepamo; Finance Manager of PF, Lebohang Makhoali; Operations Manager of PF and Thato Kolisang; Corporate Affairs Manager.
