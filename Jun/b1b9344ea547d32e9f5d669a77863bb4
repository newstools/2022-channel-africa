A convoy carrying a Jordanian contingent came under fire from small arms and rocket propelled grenades in the northern region of Kidal, it said. Three others were injured. It is not clear who carried out the attack but Minusma was created in 2013 to help defend the country against Islamist militants. The UN has lost more than 170 of its peacekeepers in Mali since then. A transitional military council is ruling the country after ousting the elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, in 2020. --BBC-
