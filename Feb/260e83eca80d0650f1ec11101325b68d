The World Health Organisation (WHO) says this is the region’s largest-ever vaccine rollout in a single year.

The WHO, however, says Africa remains the continent with the lowest vaccination rates in the world.

Now, the WHO, together with the United Nations Children’s Agency, and the Global Alliance for Vaccine Initiative, Gavi, will roll out mass vaccination campaigns in 10 priority countries to reach 100 million people by the end of April this year.

During its weekly media briefing, the WHO regional office for Africa said so far, only 13% of Africans are fully vaccinated.

Eighteen countries have vaccinated less than 10% of their population and three have vaccinated less than 1%.

Twenty-nine countries have used less than 50% of their vaccine stock.
