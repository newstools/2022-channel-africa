The Super Falcons, who had a 2-0 advantage heading into the second leg, netted with three minutes remaining through Esther Okoronkwo. Elsewhere, Tunisia secured their ticket to the tournament after overcoming two-time champions Equatorial Guinea 7-3 on aggregate despite losing 3-2 in Malabo. Meanwhile, Cameroon won 2-1 in The Gambia to wrap up a 10-1 overall triumph for the three-time runners-up and Botswana, Burkina Faso and Togo will all be making their debuts at the finals. The Burkinabe beat Guinea-Bissau 1-0 to progress 7-0 on aggregate while Togo won 2-1 in Gabon to go through 4-2 over the two legs. Botswana qualified on away goals following a 2-0 defeat at home by Zimbabwe, with the Zebras going through courtesy of their 3-1 win in last week's first leg in Harare. Those seven sides join hosts Morocco, Uganda, Burundi, Zambia and Senegal to complete the line-up for the 12-team tournament. Morocco will host the Women's Nations Cup from 2-23 July, with the four semi-finalists automatically qualifying for the 2023 Women's World Cup. --BBC--
