Jeffery Moyo, a freelance reporter for the United States publication, denies that he assisted them to obtain false media accreditation cards. The two journalists, Joao Silva and Christina Goldbaum, were deported to South Africa days after their arrival. Moyo was arrested in May last year and went on trial in January. If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in jail. More witnesses for the prosecution will take the stand as the trial resumes in the southern city of Bulawayo. Moyo, who says he was questioned by the anti-terrorism police unit, arrested and jailed without bail for three weeks, believes he is on trial for practising journalism. International media groups have called on authorities to drop the charges. --BBC--
