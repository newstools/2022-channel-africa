Noureddine Bhiri has been detained after being taken away from his home on December 31 for suspected terrorism offences. A second man was taken away and detained on the same day. “We urge the authorities to either promptly release or properly charge these two men in accordance with due process standards for criminal proceedings,” said said Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office. Tunisia’s President, Kais Saied, suspended parliament last July and began ruling by decree in a move opponents branded as a coup. Bhiri, who initially went on hunger strike, remains in hospital under guard. --BBC--
