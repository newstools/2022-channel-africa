The salvage tugboat bought from Turkey and three ship-to-shore gantry cranes from Japan will boost efficiency and bulk handling activities at the second container terminal. This follows Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta’s order to boost businesses in East Africa. Last week, when he visited the Kipevu Oil Terminal, the President urged port officials to boost efficiency and deal with challenges including congestion. The multi-purpose tugboat boat will provide rescue services, marine salvage, fire suppression at sea and control maritime pollution. KPA General Manager for operations and harbour Sudi Mwasingo said the newly-acquired salvage tugboat will open new business for the port. KPA has already received requests for the use of the tugboat for rescue marine operations during emergencies. "The authority can recover the sum spent to acquire the tugboat during its operations. It will not only assist in salvage operations at sea but open a new market," he said at the new dockyard tug jetty at the port of Mombasa. Mwasingo said the cranes will assist the port in increased berth throughput, faster ship turnaround and reduced waiting time. Acting General Manager KPA Engineering Services, Javan Wanga, said offloading and commissioning of the gantry cranes to make them ready for use will take two months. He said the equipment will position the port for Mombasa to be a hub port within the region. --TheEastAfrican--
