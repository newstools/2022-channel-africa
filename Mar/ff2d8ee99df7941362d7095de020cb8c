He has called the 4.9% annual gross domestic product increase in 2021 an anomaly, saying that the economy will revert back to pre-pandemic low growth rates. Gqubule added that the only reason the economy grew by such a high number is because there was no hard lockdown last year, and the growth was measured from a low base in 2020. "Our government has got this insane logic, that government spending must decline during the worst depression in almost a century and government refuse to spend money during and after Covid-19. The only solution to this crisis is for the government to open the taps and start spending. I don’t know why that is so difficult to understand from the government."
