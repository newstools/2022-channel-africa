Civic organisations and teachers unions have been calling for the reopening, saying children were being denied their right to education. There are also concerns that schools do not have enough teachers. Earlier this week, the government announced plans to recruit 10 000 teachers to fill vacancies at primary and secondary schools. More than four million children were denied partial or full time learning in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Obert Masaraure, National President of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe said since the onset of the pandemic, no meaningful learning has taken place. “If you’re looking at the numbers of the learners who are accessing education through radio, those numbers are pathetic”, said Masaraure. Masaraure said over 90% of learners had no access to education during the pandemic. “It was an elite programme of learning that could only be accessed by those who had internet and electricity and could afford private tutors”. According to a report by Unicef, the indefinite closure of schools has affected 4.6-million children in Zimbabwe. Statistics released from Zimstat, the country’s official statistics agency, show that 60% of the school-going population dropped out of school in Bulawayo and 56% in Harare. --ChannelAfrica--
