"The department can attest that there are illegal recruitment practices happening. There are some employers who continue to employ especially undocumented foreign nationals and citizens who continue to be subjected to inferior labour standards," the department said in a statement. Some employers do not declare them in their books and do not cover them in terms of existing social protection measures such as the Unemployment Insurance Fund Pension Fund and Compensation Fund. The department said it has developed a new National Labour Migration Policy and proposed amendments to the existing Employment Services Act. --ChannelAfrica--
