The head of the Association of the Tunisian Community in Ukraine, Tariq Alaoui, said that Tunisians have been struggling to leave Ukraine due to international airlines cancelling flights. Alaoui told Tunisia's state news agency that anxiety had heightened within the community following Russia's announcement to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. Aloaui said there were about 1 500 Tunisian nationals in Ukraine, including some 500 students. Many of them reside in Dnipro and Kharkiv, near the Russian border, he said. Other countries, including Morocco, had begun repatriation efforts, Alaoui added. The Tunisian Foreign Ministry on February 20 called on Tunisians to leave areas of Ukraine where there was significant tension and to maintain continuous contact with the Tunisian embassies in Moscow and Warsaw. The ministry also said Tunisian nationals wishing to be repatriated could register with the Association of the Tunisian Community in Ukraine, without clarifying if the ministry would coordinate an evacuation. --BBC--
