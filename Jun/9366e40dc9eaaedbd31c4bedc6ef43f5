She said critics should travel to the eastern Africa country to see the progress it had made. "The narrative that living in Africa is a punishment is insulting for those who live here and are working hard to build our countries. We want Africa to succeed. Rwanda has made tremendous progress. People should come and see," Makolo tweeted. The first flight due to take UK asylum seekers to Rwanda was cancelled on Tuesday evening after an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights. The Rwanda asylum plan, announced by the UK government in April, intends to take some asylum seekers on a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead. The UK government has said the scheme would discourage others from crossing the English Channel. --BBC--
