Morocco's government announced the decision to cancel the mandatory PCR test for travelers today. The decision will come into effect immediately, a statement from the Head of Government office reads. The government explained the decision was taking into account the improvement of the epidemiological situation in Morocco. Prior to the decision, travelers had to present a negative PCR test and their COVID-19 pass. The decision came a few weeks ahead of the start of Operation Marhaba 2022. Operation Marhaba, an annual initiative facilitating the transit of Moroccans residing abroad (MREs), starts in June. The decision is also expected to revive Morocco’s tourism sector further. Minister of Tourism, Fatim-Zahra Ammor, announced on Monday that the Moroccan tourism revenues reached nearly $1 billion in the first three months of this year. The number reflects a strong comeback for the industry, which witnessed a devastating crisis after the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020. The crisis was mainly in the first and second years of COVID-19 when travel restrictions were updated frequently depending on the epidemiological situation. It was until February 7, 2022, that the North African country reopened its airspace for travelers, who must present their negative PCR test and their vaccine pass upon arrival. Despite the easing of restrictions, Morocco is still under a state of emergency that the government announced in March 2020. The measure allows authorities to take proactive measures to tackle any potential deterioration. --MoroccoWorldNews--
