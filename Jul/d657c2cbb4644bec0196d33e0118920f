Media reports say fresh clashes took place in Rutshuru territory, North Kivu Province, forcing residents to flee their homes. The latest round of fighting erupted a day after President Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, agreed on an immediate ceasefire to resolve the conflict in the volatile region. M23 Spokesperson Willy Ngoma is quoted by the Reuters news agency describing the ceasefire agreement "an illusion". "Only the M23 can sign the cease-fire with the government," he is quoted as saying. DRC accuses Rwanda of backing the M23, which both Kigali and the rebels have consistently denied. --BBC--
