Mohammed explained that it is only the implementation of the agreements that can translate into economic benefits for both countries. He spoke yesterday when he received the Namibian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Humphrey Geiseb, who visited him in Abuja. The Minister, according to a statement by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi, observed that the bilateral cooperation between the two nations, which dates back to 1992 on the platform of the 1st Nigeria-Namibia Joint Commission, expired without implementation. He, therefore, expressed the hope that the MoUs will be revived for implementation this time around. “Because the agreement on tourism cooperation between both countries suffered from lack of follow-up, a separate MOU on tourism cooperation was decided upon during the 3rd session of the Joint Commission in 2008 and signed six years later in 2014. “Unfortunately, the MOU, which had a lifespan of five years, has expired and, until then, nothing was done by our two countries. I am aware that efforts are on to renew the MoU for another five years. Hopefully, this time, we will act to implement the MoU,” Mohammed said. “Because the agreement on tourism cooperation between both countries suffered from lack of follow-up, a separate MOU on tourism cooperation was decided upon during the 3rd session of the Joint Commission in 2008 and signed six years later in 2014. “Unfortunately, the MOU, which had a lifespan of five years, has expired and, until then, nothing was done by our two countries.
