Nxesi was responding to the blocking of roads by truck drivers on the N3 highway in KwaZulu-Natal province after drivers complained about jobs being taken by both legal and illegal foreign workers. Nxesi said the government was committed to addressing the issues in a way that ensured the long-term viability of interventions, some of which would require a “longer runway”, owing to legislative changes. He said one of the key ways that government plans to address this is through the proposed National Labour Migration Policy (NLMP). “We will not tolerate lawlessness in the form of road blocking. We urge law enforcement to unleash the full force of the law on those who use illegal means to express their grievances while undermining the rights of others,” Nxesi said.  --TheCitizen--
