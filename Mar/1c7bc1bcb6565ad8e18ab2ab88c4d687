Last week it announced that an agreement had been reached with global renewables company, EDF Renewables, to develop a regional renewable energy ecosystem that will wean Anglo’s South African operations 100% off the grid by 2030. The group plans to be carbon-neutral by 2040. Anglo American has already secured 100% renewable electricity supply for all its operations in South America, and the group expects to source 56% of its global electricity needs from renewables by 2023. At its recent 2021 annual results presentation, Anglo indicated that it intends to have three solar power plants in operation in South Africa by 2023, with hydrogen trucks being piloted this year. De Beers also plans to be carbon-neutral across all its operations by 2030. --Moneyweb--
