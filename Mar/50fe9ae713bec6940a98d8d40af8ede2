The arrangement would enable Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. to access the $8.5 billion pledged by the United States (US), United Kingdom, Germany, France and the European Union without adding to its debt burden, a person familiar with the proposal said.  

The company wants to use the money to fund the closing of some coal-fired power plants and the construction of renewable-energy facilities to replace them.   

Eskom referred questions to the presidency and the National Treasury didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The $8.5 billion was pledged at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.    

The aim is to conclude a deal, complete with investment plans, by the COP27 meeting in Egypt in November at the latest, a US official familiar with the plans said earlier this month. The deal was hailed as one of the standout achievements at COP26 and is seen as a prototype of a funding model that could be used to decarbonise other coal-dependent nations. 

Eskom accounts for about 40% of South Africa’s emissions, with almost all of those coming from its 17 coal-fired plants. --Moneyweb--
