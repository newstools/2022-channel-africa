Tunisia drilled Mauritania 4-0 in the other Group F match, while Ivory Coast were held to a 2-2 draw by Sierra Leone in Group E. Gambia and Mali moved to four points from two matches, Tunisia have three and Mauritania zero. Gambia equalised in the last minute through Musa Barrow after a handball decision against Mali, who had led for 10 minutes after Ibrahima Kone converted a spot-kick. Both penalties were awarded after the VAR advised Moroccan referee Samir Guezzaz to view the incidents on the pitchside screen. Deserved breakthrough for Mali Mali’s was belatedly given after Adama Nos Traore had been tugged down in the area. Mali had laid siege to Gambia’s goal for much of the game and deserved to finally make the breakthrough. But Gambia, competing at their first finals and having beaten Mauritania in their opening game, won a penalty of their own in the last minute when Yves Bissouma handled an attempted cross by Ebrima Colley. Gambia goalkeeper Modou Jobe made several point-blank stops in the second half. But it was Gambia who went closest to scoring before the two spot-kicks when after 20 minutes Barrow thumped an ambitious free-kick against the crossbar. He had another set-piece opportunity, from much closer in, seven minutes before half time and again hit the woodwork. Defending champions Algeria were due to face Equatorial Guinea in the late game in Group E. -TheWitness--
