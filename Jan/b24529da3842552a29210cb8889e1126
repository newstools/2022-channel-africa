This emerges from a tweet Williams posted to his account on Thursday after meeting with a number of representatives of the coordination of Libyan parties and blocs in the capital Tripoli. Williams reiterated "the United Nations' support for the Libyan people in their demand for an electoral process to overcome the long period of transition." He added that the representatives of the coordination of parties and blocs "demanded not to circumvent the will of the 2.8 million Libyans, who registered to vote in the elections." She also underlined the "need to deploy firm efforts to move forward in the realization of the process of national reconciliation and transitional justice". Stephanie Williams on Wednesday discussed with the head of the High National Electoral Commission, Imad al-Sayeh, the means proposed to support efforts to make the elections a reality. The presidential elections were to be held on December 24, according to the plan sponsored by the United Nations, but the Election Commission announced two days before its scheduled date, that the votes could not take place and suggested to postpone them for the date of January 24, when the House of Representatives (Parliament) had proposed to postpone them for 6 months. The inability to hold the elections was caused by disputes between official Libyan institutions, and in particular over electoral laws and the role of the judiciary in the electoral process. Libyans hope these elections will help end the armed conflict that has plagued the oil-rich country for years. With the interference of Arab and Western countries and foreign mercenaries, Khalifa Haftar's militia waged hostilities for years against the internationally recognized former government of national unity.  --ChannelAfrica--
