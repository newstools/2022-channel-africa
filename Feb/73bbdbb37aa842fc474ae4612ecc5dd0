This is according to a joint study by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Children’s Fund (Unicef) has found. “This report shows very clearly that formula milk marketing remains unacceptably pervasive, misleading and aggressive,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. Health professionals in Nigeria and Morocco have reported that contact with baby formula companies was extremely common in public and private health care settings. The report surveyed 8 500 parents and pregnant women, and 300 health workers in cities across the world including in Bangladesh, China, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. “We need robust policies, legislation and investments in breastfeeding to ensure that women are protected from unethical marketing practices  and have access to the information and support they need to raise their families.” said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell. Breast milk is the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies which help protect against many common childhood illnesses. The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months as the most effective way to ensure child health and survival. Breastfed children are said to perform better on intelligence tests, are less likely to be overweight and less prone to diabetes later in life. Women who breastfeed also have a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers. --BBC--
