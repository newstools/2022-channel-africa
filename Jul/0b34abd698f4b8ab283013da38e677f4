Sadok Belaid, a former constitutional law Professor, named by Saied to draft a new constitution for a new republic, said the Saied 's version is dangerous and does not resemble the first draft proposed by the constitution committee. Belaid says the draft constitution published by Saied contains chapters that could pave the way for a disgraceful dictatorial regime. Saied has not commented on the constitution since he published the text last week in Tunisia's official gazette. His proposal would dilute the roles of the parliament and judiciary, prompting accusations he is undoing democratic gains that Tunisians won in a 2011 revolution. Saied seized most powers last year, brushing aside the 2014 democratic constitution and dismissing the elected parliament to say he would rule by decree while he remakes the political system. The constitution, which would give Saied near-absolute powers, will be put to a referendum this month. --Reuters--
