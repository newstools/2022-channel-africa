The two-year study involved 39 000 Tanzanian households. In randomized trials with over 4 500 children aged six months to 14 years, mosquito nets coated with the new insecticide chlorfenapyr and with pyrethroids traditional chemicals that kill insects reduced the prevalence of malaria by 43% in the first year and 37%in the second. Traditional mosquito nets are only coated with pyrethroids. The double-coated netting also reduced clinical episodes of malaria by 44% over the two-year study period. --lethbridgenewsnow.--
