The Shelter Afrique’s Chief Executive Officer Andrew Chimphondah and Zimbabwe’s Minister of Housing and Social Amenities, Daniel Garwe, signed the host agreement in Harare last week, setting in motion preparations for the conference, which will be held in Victoria Falls, in western Zimbabwe, from July 25-30 this year. During the meeting, Cameroon’s Minister for Housing and Urban Development, Célestine Ketcha Courtès, who currently presides over the general meeting, will hand over to her Zimbabwean counterpart, Garwe. Courtès took over from Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for housing James Macharia, last year. Speaking during the signing of the host agreement, Garwe said “Shelter Afrique held its 36th AGM in Victoria Falls and their return after five years for the 41st AGM demonstrates the renewed interest in Zimbabwe, providing a window of opportunity for the government to leverage on in shaping the narrative towards robust human settlement delivery strategies.” The Zimbabwean government will be expected to provide hosting facilities and transport for designated officials and equipment required during the conference. Garwe remarked that the meeting will have many economic returns to the country, including regional integration, tourism, and business linkages. --TheEastAfrican--
