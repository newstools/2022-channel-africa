The numbers have more than quadrupled compared to 2017. "It's a record number," said Romdhane Ben Amor, the Spokesperson for the Tunisian human rights observatory, Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (FTDES), in a press conference this week. Ben Amor was referring to around 2 731 minors who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy during 2021, reported the French news agency Agence France Presse. Those young people were some of more than 10 000 unaccompanied minors who arrived in Italy in 2021 according to the latest Italian government statistics, published on March 16. So far this year, more than 870 people from Tunisia have arrived in Italy via the Mediterranean, accounting for 14% of arrivals so far. Those from Egypt account for 24% of arrivals this year, closely followed by Bangladeshi nationals who make up 20% of arrivals in 2022. The Tunisian Press Agency TAP added that in the last five years over 5 509 unaccompanied minors and 1,335 accompanied minors had left Tunisia for Italy. They joined 42 703 men and 1 251 women between 2017 and 2021. Another 53 524 were prevented from entering Italy during the same period, reported TAP. High unemployment One of the push factors for this migration was that the unemployment rate had risen again in Tunisia, up by 0.5% points compared to the last quarter of 2021, explained Ben Amor. The rate now stands at 18.4% overall. However, for young people, unemployment stood between 41.7% and 46.5% last year. People living in the south and west of Tunisia recorded the highest unemployment rates, according to TAP. The economic and political crisis in the country has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen the public health system struggling to cope and the tourism sector, on which Tunisia heavily relies, almost completely paralyzed. The agricultural and fishing sectors have also experienced huge disruptions in recent years, leading to problems in another source of employment in the country. Moreover, the persistence of corruption has been one of the causes of increasing protests. Police crackdowns on these protests, a violation of freedom and the economic situation "have been the main factors behind the increase of irregular migration in Tunisia since 2020," FTDES was quoted as saying. --infomigrants.net--
