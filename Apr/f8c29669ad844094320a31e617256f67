"I want to start the conversation about mental health because ultimately that is more important than physical health," she told BBC Sport Africa. The 27-year-old's struggle began in May last year when she was playing in Australia for Adelaide Thunderbirds. "I thoroughly enjoyed my time when I played for the club and during the season, but I did get lonely," Potgieter said. "I was living on my own and that always messes with people's minds. When you're on your own you start overthinking and start thinking of problems, and that is what happened to me. That affected me tremendously." The goal shooter returned home to South Africa in August once the league ended, but problems in her personal life sent her on a downward spiral. "When I got back home, I found out that my partner of one and a half years had been seeing someone else while I was overseas," she explained. "I think there were so many things that were building up; with the netball and the stress and travelling, jetlag, Covid, quarantine this past couple of years, no stability at all, and then a betrayal when I got back. I think that sent me over the edge." Following club duty, Potgieter was due to join the national team for a training camp in September, but her symptoms got so bad she had to seek medical help. "I was not training, feeling sad, not excited to go and play the sport that I love so much and also crying," Potgieter narrates. "Every morning I woke up and I cried. My mom slept next to me because if she didn't, I wouldn't go to sleep  but at least if she was there, I cried myself to sleep. In five days I lost seven kilos. "I think the big sign for me was when I cried before getting on a plane to the training camp. That had never happened to me before ever. I think those were the moments that I realised 'You can't cry this much, something's not right'." --BBC--
