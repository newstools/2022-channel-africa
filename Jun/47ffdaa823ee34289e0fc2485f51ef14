The resumption that will see the airline fly four weekly direct flights from its Istanbul’s hub using Airbus A330-300, comes two years after the airline suspended its operations due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Officiating the recommencement of the flights, Deputy Minister for Works and Transport Atupele Mwakibete said the new development is a vote of confidence in Tanzania as a safe destination for business and leisure. He acknowledged the government’s efforts under President Samia Suluhu Hassan for launching the Royal Tour film which will contribute significantly to the growth of tourism and investment. “The Turkish Airlines has resumed its operations at KIA at the right time since the government has invested a lot in marketing the country’s attractions and investments which we believe will drive the demand of air transport,” said  Mwakibete. He exuded optimism that Turkish Airlines will bring Kilimanjaro with much easier reach to passengers from Istanbul and the rest of the world. “This will be an incredible boost to our economy and particularly the tourism industry,” he said. Kilimanjaro and its neighbouring regions of Tanga, Arusha and Manyara host some of the most unique and important tourist attraction sites in the country. Kilimanjaro Airports Development Company (Kadco) board Chairperson Natu Mwamba said: “The importance of this direct route from Istanbul to Kilimanjaro cannot be taken for granted.” According to Mwamba the resumption of the Turkish operations will stimulate the market and multiply the number of passengers traveling to the country. This, she added, will therefore support the government’s strategic objective of increasing the annual number of tourists from 1.4 million recorded last year to 5 million come 2025. --TheEastAfrican--
