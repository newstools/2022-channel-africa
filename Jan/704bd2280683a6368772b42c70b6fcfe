The UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics 2021 shows that there was a strong increase of 22.4% in the value of global merchandise trade this year compared with 2020. According to the trade agency, the strong growth will push the value of world trade in goods about 15% higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic. “Global merchandise trade recovered fast, exceeding its pre-crisis level by the end of 2020,” it said. For global services trade, the recovery path seen in the first six months of 2021 was expected to continue strongly into the third quarter of 2021. “The trade in services, however, will still fall short of pre-pandemic levels despite the 13.6% growth for 2021, after a deep contraction recorded in 2020,” UNCTAD said. The report does not reflect the potential impacts of the new Omicron variant. In the data released this month, South Africa led in exporter country rank by value, with an annual growth rate of -4.6% followed by Morocco (-6.8%) and Nigeria at -43%. Travel was severely affected, shedding an immense 63% in 2020 and strongly upsetting tourism-oriented economies. International transport sales passengers and freight dropped by 20% while exports of business, intellectual property, financial and insurance services showed more resilience. Meanwhile, trade in telecommunications, computer and information services continued growing throughout the pandemic, except in Africa. The annual report presents the statistical landscape for 2020 through a wide variety of statistics relevant to international trade, investment, maritime transport and development. It also depicts developments in 2021 through data-led projections, known as nowcasts, for now and the immediate future. --TheEastAfrican--
