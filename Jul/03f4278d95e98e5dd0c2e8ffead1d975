Addressing delegates at the Africa Protected Areas Congress conference, Rwanda’s Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente said it was high time that African policymakers put in place strong measures and strategies to ensure that the devastation of the continent’s rich biodiversity was stopped. Organisers said the week-long meeting would aim to protect Africa's wildlife and sustainable development while conserving the continent's cultural heritage and traditions. Delegates are meeting under the umbrella of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It represents hundreds of organisations and thousands of experts around the world. --BBC--
