This was confirmed yesterday by SAA Spokesperson, Maistry Vimla, and President of the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA), Zazi Sibanyoni-Mngambi. Vimla said the workers were under no illusions about being absorbed into the fledging airline, had stayed on for training instead of taking up Voluntary Service Packages (VSP) with the understanding that the training programme would end after 12 months. "The training did not materialise, there was no allocation for it. It was a social programme we initiated so as to not put workers out into the street without some form of training. The thing is they are mostly cabin crew members and do not have scarce skills. With a smaller fleet, there is no way we could absorb them into operations," Vimla said. She said the entire programme had been a negotiated settlement with the unions. Sibanyoni-Mngambi said SACCA was aghast at the latest development which she said came about because SAA could not provide updated financial statements to the CCMA when required to. Sibanyoni-Mngambi said the union was exploring its options, had engaged with the Department of Public Enterprises for intervention as well as is consulting with its legal team on the way forward. She said SACCA's consternation came from that SAA still recruited some workers who had already left under the VSP. The 225 workers are in addition to about 3 000 workers let go after SAA went into restructuring. Vimla stressed that the workers would not take up the VSP packages they deferred 12 months ago. SAA is under restructuring now involving the Takatso Consortium which last week confirmed, along with cabinet, that it would take a 51% stake in the airline when the sale and purchase process has been concluded subject to regulatory approval of bodies including the Competition Commission. --IOL--
