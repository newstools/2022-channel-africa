Ramaphosa delivered his sixth state of the nation address last night at the Cape Town City Hall. His speech gave reassurance regarding economic transformation, government's fight against corruption, health achievements and immigration policies. The President’s address underlined the role of the private sector in digging the country out of its growth slump, which has been characterised by a deepening unemployment crisis. In the third quarter of 2021, the unemployment rate hit 34.9%  the highest level since 2008. Acknowledging the crisis, the President noted that Covid-19 “has exacerbated the divide between those who are employed and those who are unemployed”. “Last year our unemployment rate reached its highest recorded level. Unemployment has been caused by low growth, which has resulted from the long-term decline in investment in our economy, which has lasted for a number of years.” Ramaphosa said that the state “must create an environment in which the private sector can invest and unleash the dynamism of our economy”. He later added that it is a key task of the government to create the conditions to enable the private sector: “And this is the case, whether we like it or not, all over the world. It is when the government creates that environment that will enable businesses both small and big to emerge, to grow, to access new markets, to create new products and to hire more employees.” Ramaphosa announced that policymakers are reviewing the Business Act and other regulations to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses. The president has appointed a team, led by former Exxaro Chief Executive, Sipho Nkosi, to cut red tape across the economy. --ChannelAfrica--
