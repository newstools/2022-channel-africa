Popularly known as “Akwaaba”, it is to be supervised by a government-run firm and two other insurers. All visitors regardless of the duration of stay and nationality will have to get it. The announcement has been met with criticism from travel sector players and business experts who see the move as just one more hurdle to doing business in the country. “You can’t force anyone to buy a policy if it’s not needed,” trade expert John Kennedy of Bespoke Business Consulting told the BBC, adding that many travellers already have insurance. “Making it compulsory wouldn't work as they need to prove beyond reasonable doubt the intent, usefulness and benefit.” --BBC--
