A combination of back-order fulfillment, normal replacement patterns, pure organic growth and recovery of the hospitality industry added to a mixed bag of positive outcomes to reach 464 122 new vehicle sales in 2021. The overall recovery trend is expected to continue into 2022 with growth projected between 8% and 10% to a level of 500 000 new units in 2022. It should be noted, however, that the decline in vehicle sales had bottomed out prior to the onset of the COVID- 19, with the upward trajectory disrupted directly by the pandemic itself, both in local and export sales. The very essence of the COVID- 19 pandemic did, however, result is some significant changes to the supply and demand dynamics within the automotive industry globally as export countries recovered at different levels and local business operating models also changed to manage continuity. “In our attempt to join the dots, it is noted that the local drivers for vehicle demand are somewhat unique given the nature of the South African market and how the country responded to some of the changes”, said Cyril Zhungu, Head of Automotive Retail Finance at Standard Bank South Africa. Zhungu says there remains residual supply side back-orders following the component and chip shortages widely reported in 2021, all of which are expected to settle down soon, thus providing a stable vehicles sales projection for 2022. “On the back of such a positive view, one cannot discount some of the downside risks within the South African economy related to reported increased levels of unemployment, following business closures and rationalization of operations”, Zhungu added. There is an increase in consumer debt levels as reflected in the change of the country’s debt-to-disposable income ratio from 71.9% in 2018 to 77% in 2020, according to the South African Reserve Bank, which together with a possible upward adjustment to cost of credit as interest rates normalize again by at least 50 basis points in 2022 on the back of higher consumer inflation which may affect the said projected growth in vehicles sales. --Amanda Matshaka/Channel Africa--
