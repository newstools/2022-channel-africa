Previously, all arrivals, regardless of vaccination status, were required to present a negative PCR test result taken within 72 hours before departure. Children aged 17 and under travelling with a vaccinated parent or guardian are exempt from providing proof of vaccination. However, under the new rules, which came into force on March 12, Covid testing on arrival is still mandatory. Holidaymakers must also arrange Covid health insurance cover before travelling to the Indian Ocean destination. Non-vaccinated arrivals will still need to quarantine for seven days. The easing of restrictions follows similar moves by destinations such as the Maldives, Malaysia and Bali. The Maldives recently dropped all testing requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals. While Malaysia and Bali have both announced they will open up to tourists for quarantine-free travel for the first time since the start of the pandemic. --inews.co.uk--
