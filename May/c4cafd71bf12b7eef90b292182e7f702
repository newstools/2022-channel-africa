Fresh from victory at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix where he led Sergio Perez home in a resounding Red Bull one-two, the 24-year-old Dutchman arrives in Florida trailing championship leader Leclerc of Ferrari by 27 points. After four races, both drivers know there is a long way to go in the title race and will be aware that their long-awaited Formula One duel has captured the imagination ahead of Sunday's keenly-anticipated contest. Round five of the new era battle between a younger generation of racers takes place at the self-styled Miami International Autodrome, a fast street track built around car parks at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. The stadium is, by rich irony, home to the NFL's Miami Dolphins whose name serves to remind F1's bruised drivers of the pain generated by their new ground effect cars this season as they bump up and down, 'proposing' at high speeds on the straights. --News24--
