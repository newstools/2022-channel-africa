Reports from Nyala, the capital of South Darfur State, say that students were injured by security forces trying to break up the demonstration. Teachers there have also taken to the streets to express their anger after police officers beat colleagues inside a school on Sunday. Sudan has seen almost daily protests against last year's military coup. Correspondents say the continuing economic crisis with rising inflation is fuelling further anger and increasing pressure on the military rulers. --BBC--
