The Pretoria-based Land and Agricultural Development Bank of South Africa has been struggling to find a way forward since missing a loan repayment in April 2020 that triggered a cross-default in notes issued under a $4 billion bond programme. "We hope to get it out of default by the end of the financial year," Chairperson Thabi Nkosi said in an interview on Tuesday. “We are already in advanced talks with lenders," with 28% of liabilities having been settled, she said. The Land Bank has been seen as a potential harbinger for how debt at other struggling state companies will be handled. Arms maker Denel last week said it was seeking government help after missed bond payments put it at risk of default. Eskom, the national power utility, has $26 billion of debt and is dependent on state bailouts. The government has committed $46 million in support for the Land Bank over the next three years, having already paid in $20 million in the form of a bailout. Futuregrowth Asset Management, a creditor that has previously described proposals made by the Land Bank as “unsatisfactory,” declined to comment. Nkosi’s comments come after the Land Bank announced that Chief Executive Officer Ayanda Kanana had resigned, along with Litha Magingxa, who oversaw agricultural economics and was acting head of strategy. --Moneyweb--
