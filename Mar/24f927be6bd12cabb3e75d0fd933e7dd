No reasons were given for the firing of Elizabeth Acuei Yol. She is the first cabinet Minister from the party of the First Vice-President Riek Machar, the Sudan People’s Liberation in Opposition, to be dismissed from the unity government. Kiir and Machar formed the unity government in February 2020 after sealing a peace deal aimed at ending six years of civil war. During her tenure, Acuei was praised by health partners for the country's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But she also faced criticisms for her handling of the ministry's affairs, which saw her booed by Member of Parliament (MP) in December during a presentation in parliament. The MPs urged Machar to recommend for her dismissal over what they described as incompetence. --BBC--
