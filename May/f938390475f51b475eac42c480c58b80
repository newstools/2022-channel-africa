Morocco first announced a state of emergency in March 2020 when a few cases of COVID-19 broke out in the North African country. Since then, the government has been extending the measure as part of its efforts to tackle the COVID crisis. Morocco has been easing COVID restrictions amid a significant improvement in the epidemiological situation this year. The government lifted the travel ban on February 7, allowing international travelers to access or leave the country if they are fully vaccinated. In May, however, Morocco announced a new update, allowing Moroccans and international travellers to enter the country if they are vaccinated or if they present a negative PCR test. On May 18, the Moroccan Ministry of Health said children under 12 are exempt from all travel requirements to enter Morocco. Under the current requirements, the second dose should not be more than four months old for travellers who have been administered only two doses of a COVID vaccine. But this measure does not apply to people who have been administered Johnson & Johnson or  Janssen, since one dose of this vaccine is the equivalent of two doses of other vaccines. With the annual Operation Marhaba around the corner, the decision to allow travellers to use a vaccine pass or a negative PCR test was welcomed among Moroccans abroad. Morocco will launch the 2022 Operation Marhaba in June, facilitating the transit of Moroccan diaspora who visit their country for the summer season. The number of Moroccans who cross Spain annually to come back to Morocco for summer vacation as part of the operation ranges between 2.5 million to 3 million. --moroccoworldnews.com--
