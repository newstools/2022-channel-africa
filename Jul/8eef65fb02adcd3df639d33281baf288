None of the Super Falcons players has received their allocated allowances or bonus of over $10 000 for the wins over Botswana, Burundi and Cameroon. The players boycotted training on Wednesday evening, prompting the NFF to act swiftly in order to prevent another strike before the match against Zambia on Friday. "The players have refused to leave their hotel in Casablanca over unpaid bonuses," a top NFF official told BBC Sport Africa. "There is also an issue over the unpaid first five days of camp, which the players expected in their bank accounts but has not arrived." The financially-stricken NFF, which receives its funding from the Nigerian government, has made a $1 000 payment to each player of the nine-time African champions to cover their 10 days' allowance. NFF President, Amaju Pinnick, told BBC Sport Africa on Wednesday that his organisation is "dealing with the issue", but funds need to come from the country's Sports Ministry before any payment can be made. A special adviser to the Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare, said the "issues are being resolved" and the team has received verbal assurances that they will be paid. "The issues are being resolved and the NFF has assured the team they will get all that is due to them," Toyin Ibitoye said. --BBC--
