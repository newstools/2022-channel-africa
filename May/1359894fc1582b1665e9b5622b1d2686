In a social media post, the pop star said she had "been waiting for this moment" and that this was "just the beginning". The beauty products will be available in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Rihanna, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 in a partnership with luxury goods company LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton). She is worth $1.7 billion, with an estimated $1.4 billion coming from the value of Fenty Beauty. The company reportedly made $100 million its first 40 days. It makes more money than other celebrity-founded beauty brands such as Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics, Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty and Jessica Alba's Honest Company, according to Forbes. --BBC--
