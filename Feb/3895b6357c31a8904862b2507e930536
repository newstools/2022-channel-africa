Abba Kyari, who has a reputation in Nigeria as a "super cop", is wanted by US law enforcement agencies over allegations of links to Instagram influencer and fraudster Ramon Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi. The country's attorney general said Nigeria was collaborating with the US to ensure justice is served. Hushpuppi pleaded guilty to money laundering in a US court in July 2021. US officials said that Hushpuppi had alleged in an affidavit that he got Kyari to arrest a syndicate member with whom he had fallen out.Kyari allegedly sent Hushpuppi details of a bank account in which he could deposit payment for the arrest, the statement said. The senior police officer denied any involvement but was suspended pending the outcome of the investigations. --BBC--
