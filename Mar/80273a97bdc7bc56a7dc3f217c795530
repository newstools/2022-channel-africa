A foreign affairs official told the BBC that talks are still ongoing on the evacuation process. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Geofrey Onyeama had announced that the evacuation of the stranded Nigerian students in Sumy State University would start on Monday. It is not clear how the government plans to evacuate the students given that Sumy is on the frontline. But earlier, Tanzania reported that it had made an arrangement for its citizens to leave through Russia. --BBC--
