MMA says the Minister is trying to force the public broadcaster to comply with what she says. Ntshavheni has threatened to withhold the release of the next financial assistance for the SABC’s turnaround strategy. The stance follows the SABC’s media statement on Friday that the public broadcaster was losing revenue due to the planned switch-off of all analogue transmitters at the end of the month to migrate to digital television. Bird says they are consulting their lawyers in light of the Minister’s threats against the SABC for asserting its independence. “She’s clearly very angry and upset about this. Because it’s clearly a reaction to that and her reactions I think smack of ministerial interference. “In fact, we’re busy consulting our lawyers to have a look at that, because it’s a very real problem when your Minister, because you assert your independence, says ‘No, we’re going to now withdraw our funding, we’ll withdraw these reports, you’re misrepresented this, you’ve misrepresented that.’ “Again, why is she only bringing this now. If it was the case that she’d seen that or if that was the view that she’d held earlier. A lot of these things just don’t make sense,” Bird added. According to the SABC Board, the migration presents a risk to the public broadcaster’s turnaround plan and will deprive millions of people of public television services. The Minister said the statement contradicts information presented in the SABC quarterly performance and turnaround plan implementation reports. --SABC--
