It's the first verdict in a string of high profile sexual harassment cases at universities in Morocco. The economics lecturer at Hassan the First University, near Casablanca, was found guilty of indecent behaviour among other charges. Four more academics will appear in court on Thursday as part of the scandal. The cases were highlighted by Moroccan media last year after journalists picked up messages reported to be between students and lecturers. Activists say it's rare for sexual harassment cases to go to trial. --BBC--
