The group will serve in diplomatic missions as ambassadors and heads of mission. President Cyril Ramaphosa received their letters of credence at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria on Tuesday. The Heads of Mission-Designate are from countries including Israel, Malawi and Cuba. Although Pretoria recently led the charge to revoke Israeli’s observer status at the African Union, Tel Aviv’s new ambassador to South Africa, Eliav Belotsercovky, had praise for the country. “There is so much we can do together in the field of science, technology, education and training. “One example of such cooperation from both countries had worked during Covid-19. We have been working together using Israeli methods to empower young women on leadership and self-development. “On food security, we have been using Israeli plans and technologies to create vegetable gardens in schools. An Israeli non-governmental organisation and Vision Africa have already connected hundreds of South Africans from rural areas of Limpopo to running water using Israeli technologies and expertise,” Belotsercovky adds. --SABC-- His Excellency President @CyrilRamaphosa receives Letter of Credence from the Ambassador of the Republic of Cuba, His Excellency Mr Enrique Orta González,on the occasion of the Credentials Ceremony at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Tshwane #BetterAfricaBetterWorld pic.twitter.com/cEBxbSYRlh
