The money will now be given to the ministry of education to help more than 2 000 students in need of bursaries, the Minister of Finance Situmbeko Musokotwane has said. The announcement was made at an event attended by Musokotwane, Minister of Education Douglas Syakalima and officials from the Anti-Corruption Commission. Money was found last year in a house belonging to journalist Margaret Musonda, also known as Faith Musonda, and was subsequently forfeited to the state as part of a deal for her not to be prosecuted. --BBC--
