The veteran opposition Politician, who is Vice President of the newly-formed Citizens Convergence for Change, formerly Movement for Democratic Change, was picked up by three police officers as he campaigned in the Greendale suburb of Harare, party spokesperson  Fadzayi Mahere told AFP. He was taken to Harare Central Police Station but later "released without charge," said Mahere. The 55-year-old politician was taken outside a supermarket, about 10 kilometres east of central Harare, where he was reportedly speaking to supporters. Mahere said it was unconstitutional for police to arrest opposition politicians arbitrarily and without any charge. Biti is the favourite to reclaim his Harare East seat in the March 26 vote after he was recalled from parliament last April. Biti's arrest has stoked fears of a wave of arrests of opposition leaders ahead of the by-elections. --AFP--
