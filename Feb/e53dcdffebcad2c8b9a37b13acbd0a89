Opposition leader Jean Ping had urged the constitutional court to declare a power vacuum, citing the President's health. Presidential spokesperson Jessye Ella Ekogha said President Ali Bongo was performing his presidential duties well. He said the opposition's line about there being a power vacuum was like a "broken record" and an attempt by an unpopular party to gain media attention. "Repeating a lie 100 times does not make it true," he said. Since the president suffered a stroke in 2018, there has been much speculation about his health and ability to continue ruling the country. --BBC--
