The AA also urged the Minister not to increase the general fuel and road accident levies, as it will negatively impact on poor communities. Currently, these two levies combined account for as much as $0.40 to every litre of petrol and diesel sold in the country. The AA said neighbouring countries who buy fuel directly from South Africa do not add these taxes to their fuel pricing, therefore their fuel is sold cheaper. The organisation's spokesperson, Layton Beard said a letter of suggestions and a petition will be handed to the minister before he tables the budget. “When you look at the management of the Road Accident Fund (RAF) it's obviously being managed quite poorly. There is a need for more efficient and proper management there”, said Beard. “Yet in our view, money is going to that organisation every year and in our opinion it’s not being used or allocated wisely”. Beard said one of the ways to mitigate the rising fuel costs is to look at the management of the RAF and see whether there are possibilities for collaboration with the private sector in the management of the agency.  --SABC--
