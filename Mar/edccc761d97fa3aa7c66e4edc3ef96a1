Guterres also appealed for an immediate ceasefire to allow for progress in serious political negotiations aimed at reaching a peace agreement based on the principles of the UN Charter. “I've been in close contact with several countries that have been talking to the parties at the highest level in order to explore the different forms of mediations leading to a political solution”, said Guterres. Guterres said since the beginning of the Russian invasion a month ago, the war has led to the senseless loss of thousands of lives, the displacement of ten million people, mainly women and children, the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure, and skyrocketing food and energy prices worldwide. In the past month, beyond support to refugee hosting countries, the UN’s humanitarian agencies and partners have reached nearly 900 000 people, mainly in eastern Ukraine, with food, shelter, blankets, medicine, bottled water, and hygiene supplies, he said.  --SABC/UN--
