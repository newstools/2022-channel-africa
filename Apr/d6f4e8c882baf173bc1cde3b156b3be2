The Turkish company is poised to start generating 1,118 megawatts of power in Ivory Coast, Brazil, the Dominican Republic and New Caledonia, a French territory, this year.

Yet the three projects it won in South Africa have stalled, with 1 220 megawatts of planned capacity mired in legal battles and environmental controversies.

While Karpowership struggles in South Africa – the company won the bids in April last year, the projects elsewhere are expected to start up in well under a year. 

In Africa’s most-industrialised nation, it’s yet to get environmental approvals and hasn’t managed to sign agreements with the national power and port utilities. 

The award of the contracts has also attracted opposition from environmental activists who want the country to transition to renewable energy faster.
