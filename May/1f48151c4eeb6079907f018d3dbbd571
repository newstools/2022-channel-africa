Mondli Khumalo, who plays for North Petherton, was attacked in the early hours of Sunday morning. The 20-year-old also used to play for South Africa's under-19s and is currently receiving treatment. A suspect has since been arrested and released while an investigation continues. "We're taking steps to ensure Mondli's family in South Africa are being kept fully updated on his condition, as well as how our investigation is progressing," Supt Richard Turner from Avon and Somerset police said. North Petherton Cricket Club said it was "shocked" by the incident and sent its well wishes to Khumalo. --BBC--
