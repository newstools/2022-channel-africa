About 2 000 migrants are expelled from Algeria and Libya monthly on average, MSF documented, denouncing the two countries’ indiscriminate expulsion of people with “severe injuries, rape victims, and people suffering from serious trauma.” According to the MSF, the expelled migrants are “abandoned in the middle of the desert” at the Algerian-Nigerien border without protection. Data compiled by the MSF established that Algerian authorities have deported 23 171 migrants in 2020. In Wednesday's statement, reported by AFP, MSF emphasized that people who tried to reach Europe have faced “inhumane conditions and were expelled from Algeria to Assamakka,” an area in northern Niger. Many MSFs and human rights organizations have long condemned the inhumane treatment and expulsion of migrants from Algeria. In 2018, Algerian authorities sparked outrage after the North African country abandoned 13,000 migrants in the Sahara desert without food, water, or supplies over a 14-month period. MSF renewed its concerns over Algeria’s chronic mistreatment of irregular migrants, emphasizing that such an act and the “seriousness of the abuses committed against migrants is beyond dispute.” According to the MSF, 0% of the MSG patients reported violence and inhumane treatment from Algerian and Libyan forces. “The testimonies of our patients and their physical and mental condition when they arrive in our health structures prove that these people have gone through hell during their expulsion from Algerian and Libyan territory,” said Jamal Marrouch, MSF’s Chief of mission in Niger. --moroccoworldnews.com--
