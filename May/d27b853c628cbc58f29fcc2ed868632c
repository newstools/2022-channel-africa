The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested Rochas Okorocha in the capital, Abuja, on allegations of corruption involving diversion of 2.9 billion naira $7 million of public funds and property. The alleged offences were committed during his tenure as governor of the south-eastern state of Imo between 2011 and 2019. He has previously denied the accusations. The 59-year-old politician is currently a Senator. He is being detained by the EFCC. Reports indicate there was a stand-off for hours between some of Okorocha supporters and operatives of the anti-graft agency during the arrest at his residence. His supporters say the arrest is an attempt to frustrate his presidential ambition. But in a statement, EFCC said it was "left with no option" after Okorocha had jumped the bail it granted him and also failed to honour invitations for questioning. The EFCC has mounted a crackdown on corruption that has so far seen the arrest of the country’s accountant-general who denies any wrongdoing. Nigeria is due to hold elections in February next year to choose a successor to President Muhammadu Buhari, whose second term will end in May. --BBC— Channel Africa wishes you a happy Africa Day. #WeAllAfrica #MyAfrica
