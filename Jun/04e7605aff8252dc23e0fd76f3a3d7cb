Algeria extended their perfect start in qualification for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations with a routine victory away against Tanzania. Goals from Ramy Bensebaini and Mohamed El Amine Amoura at the end of each half gave the North Africans a 2-0 win in the Group F clash in Dar-es-Salaam. The Desert Foxes were defending champions at the Nations Cup finals earlier this year but went out in the group stage in Cameroon. However, Algeria are now well on course to reach next year's tournament in Ivory Coast, with Djamel Belmadi's men holding a four-point lead at the top of their group after Uganda and Niger drew 1-1 earlier on Wednesday. Elsewhere, Congo-Brazzaville, Mozambique and Sudan picked up their first wins and Gabon and Mauritania drew to extend their unbeaten starts. Algeria were again without injured Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez after beating Uganda at home on Saturday, and recorded a second consecutive 2-0 triumph. Borussia Monchengladbach left-back Bensebaini broke the deadlock two minutes into first-half added time after a free-kick was flicked on to the back post, and Amoura rounded off the game in the 89th minute. His initial shot hit the upright and the forward was then teed up by Ismael Bennacer before firing into the roof of the net to notch his first international goal. After two rounds of matches, Niger are the closest challengers to the Desert Foxes after grabbing a point against Uganda in Kitende. The Cranes took the lead two minutes before half-time when Milton Karisa's cross from the right wing evaded the Nigerien goalkeeper, but Amadou Sabo advanced from halfway to curl in a stunning equaliser from the edge of the box with 19 minutes remaining. Niger have two points, while Tanzania and Uganda both have one, with the next qualifiers scheduled for September. --BBC--
