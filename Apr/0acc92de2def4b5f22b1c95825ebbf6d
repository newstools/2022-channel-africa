The hotel, which is owned 40.57% by the government, has pointed to other factors beyond Covid-19 for the planned closure after more than 50 years of operation from its location at the heart of the central business district. “Following extensive discussions with the hotel ownership, Hilton Nairobi will close its doors for the last time on December 31, 2022 and cease operations,” a Hilton spokesperson told the Business Daily in an interview. “Covid-19 created unprecedented challenges for our industry. However, the decision to cease operations is not directly connected to the pandemic. “Unfortunately, the closure of the hotel will result in a retrenchment process. However, we will work with those impacted to help them find alternative employment,” Hilton said on Wednesday. The hotel said it will redeploy some staff to hotels within its Hilton portfolio in Nairobi. Hilton said on Wednesday it will not quit Kenya and will continue to operate its other brands in the country. “Hilton Nairobi Hurlingham and Hilton Garden Inn Nairobi Airport are growing our portfolio with new hotel development opportunities in the city and beyond,” it said. The government has over the past decade struggled to offload its ownership in three luxury hotels, including Hilton. --TheCitizen--
