A national dialog on reforms will include four major organisations in Tunisia, Saied added, referring to the UGTT labor union, the lawyers union, the Federation of Industry and trade and the Tunisian League of Human Rights. 

Saied has seized control of the country's election commission seen as a blow to the democratic gains of the country's 2011 revolution and meant the body was no longer independent. He has already dismissed parliament and taken control of the judiciary after assuming executive authority last summer and saying he could rule by decree in moves his opponents denounce as a coup. Saied, who says his actions were both legal and needed to save Tunisia from a crisis, is rewriting the democratic constitution introduced after the 2011 revolution and says he will put it to a referendum in July.
