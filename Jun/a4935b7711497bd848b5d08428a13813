Biden has also urged states to temporarily suspend local fuel taxes, which are often higher than federal rates. The administration says Russia's invasion of Ukraine is to blame, in part, for the high prices of petrol and diesel. To change the so-called gas tax would require an act of Congress. Republicans are calling this move nothing but a gimmick, in that the President's proposal is basically dead on arrival. Critics say that it actually won't really benefit consumers, it will only benefit oil and gas companies, saying Biden is basically imploring those companies to pass on the savings to the consumer. Eliminating the tax would cost the government $10 billion in revenue. --BBC--
