Osaka, also champion in 2019, raced into a 5-0 lead in the first set before world number 50 Osorio fought back. However, Osaka quickly reasserted her control and wrapped up a 6-3 6-3 win. After taking a four-month break at the end of last season to protect her mental health, the 24-year-old returns to Grand Slam action as the 13th seed. "I thought I played pretty well given the circumstances," said Osaka, who has won 23 of her past 24 matches in Melbourne. "Overall I'm happy to be here and see everyone in the audience. "I like the hot conditions but when I come here everyone is warm and welcoming. I'm sure that has a positive effect on me." The four-time Grand Slam champion will play American world number 54 Madison Brengle in round two on Wednesday. Brengle, 31, progressed after Ukrainian opponent Dayana Yastremska retired when trailing 6-1 0-6 5-0. --BBC--
