The arrests in Mozambique come less than three days after the neutralisation of a South African accused of leading the kidnappings in both countries. Among those arrested are, according to the National Criminal Investigation Service, Sernic, the number two in the gang and three others who are operatives. The ringleader is on the run in South Africa. Last week, three individuals were arrested between Monday and Tuesday on charges of kidnappings in Maputo City. They fell into the hands of the authorities as they were preparing for another crime, according to the National Criminal Investigation Service. --ChannelAfrica--
