Botswana come into this one looking to maintain their winning ways, though they will face a wounded Nigeria outfit that is desperate to get some points onto their column on the table standings. Botswana Head Coach, Gaoletlhoo Nkutlwisang, said ahead of the match: “We fancy a good challenge. One thing for me as a Coach, I want to play against the big coaches and for the team, we want to face the best. That motivates us so we will go out there and show who we are as Botswana.” The game will be played at Moulay Hassan in Rabat, Morocco.  --AFCON--
