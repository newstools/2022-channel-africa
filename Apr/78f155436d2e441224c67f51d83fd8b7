The refugees, who were hosted at the Tongogara refugee camp, were accused of looting a food supply warehouse and were initially arrested in August 2021. DRC authorities rejected approximately 15 of these refugees, whom the government then placed in detention facilities in Harare. As of November last year, the Tongogara Refugee Camp hosted 15 797 refugees and asylum seekers, despite the facility being designed to host 3 000 refugees. The majority of refugees are from the DRC representing 76% of the bulk, followed by Mozambique at 11 percent, Burundi at 6% and Rwanda five percent. --The East African--
