Banyana Banyana were held to a 1-1 draw by Algeria at the Stade Omar Hamadi in Algiers on Wednesday night, but they progressed 3-1 on aggregate after they won 2-0 at home at last week. The Algerians finished the game with 10 players as midfielder Belkaceme Lyndia got her second yellow card of the game and received her marching orders. Banyana captain, Janine Van Wyk, made her way back into the starting 11, replacing veteran counterpart Noko Matlou in the heart of the defence as Banyana looked to seal their place at Awcon 2022. This will be South Africa's 13th appearance at the continental tournament. Banyana Banyana head coach Desiree Ellis spoke to Channel Africa Sport on the team's qualification. --ChannelAfrica--
