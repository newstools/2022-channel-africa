The flare-up of violence in Afar this year came after fighting in the neighbouring regions of Tigray and Amhara had ground to a stalemate and as moves were gathering pace to get the government in Addis Ababa and Tigrayan rebels to agree to peace negotiations. "There cannot be peace in Ethiopia while there is fighting in Afar," said Mussa Ibrahim, a clan leader in Erepti, one of six districts in Afar currently occupied by Tigrayan forces. Last week, Ethiopia announced a unilateral ceasefire, the second to be called in a 16-month conflict that has displaced millions of people and plunged hundreds of thousands into famine conditions. But Afar Police Commissioner Ahmed Harif told Reuters on Monday that fighting was on-going in two of the six districts occupied by Tigrayan fighters, and there was a "significant" build-up of Tigrayan forces along the border. Humanitarian organisations in the region confirmed the fighting. The last time the government declared a unilateral ceasefire in July, following months of battles that forced the military out of Tigray, the TPLF dismissed it as a "joke" and continued fighting, saying key conditions for peace had not been met. Tigrayan forces first entered Afar and the adjacent region of Amhara in July. At the time, the TPLF said it was trying to break a strangle hold blocking aid convoys from entering the region and to force Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Amhara allies to withdraw from a contested area in western Tigray. A government offensive in December pushed Tigrayan forces back into their region. This time around the warring parties dispute who initiated the violence, and the motives for it are less clear. Ethiopia's government denies blocking aid and blames the fighting in Afar for cutting off the only route humanitarian convoys can take into Tigray.  --Reuters--
