The Forum will focus on the implications of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) on the air transport and tourism sectors, which are recovering from a financial crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, related new market developments, technological advancements, and the huge business and investments opportunities in these industries to accelerate economic growth. The event will feature Heads of State, top-level representatives from the African Union, the secretariat of the AfCFTA, Chief Executive Officers of African airline companies, government ministries and policymakers in the transport, infrastructure and trade sectors, private sector  investors, young entrepreneurs and innovators, among others. --ChannelAfrica--
