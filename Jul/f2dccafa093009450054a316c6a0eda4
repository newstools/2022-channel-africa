This year, over three million individual non-provisional taxpayers have been auto assessed by the South African Revenue Services (SARS) and will not have to file a tax return if they are satisfied with the assessment. The revenue service says it will communicate directly with those who have been automatically assessed as of this Friday. The revenue collector has also opened filing for Trust Funds. SARS warns representative taxpayers (the trustee(s) of a Trust) or the appointed tax practitioners to file an income tax return for the Trust on an annual basis and during the Trust return filing period to avoid penalties and interest. The filling season for Trusts that are not registered for Provisional Tax runs from Friday to November 2023, and Trusts that are registered for Provisional Tax will run until January 23, 2023. --ChannelAfrica--
