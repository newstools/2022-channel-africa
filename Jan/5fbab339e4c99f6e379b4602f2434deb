EECAS is an organisation promoting regional economic cooperation in Central Africa. Created in December 1981, it aims to achieve collective autonomy, raise the standard of living of its population and maintain political and economic stability through harmonious cooperation. ECCAS policy includes a plan to eliminate customs duties between member states and establish a common external tariff, consolidate the free movement of goods, services and people, improve industry, transport and communications, unite commercial banks and promote the creation of a development fund.  --Jacob Tivane/Channel Africa--
