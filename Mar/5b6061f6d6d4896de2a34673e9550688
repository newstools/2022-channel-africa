The fresh fighting broke out between rival soldiers in South Sudan, threatening fragile 2018 peace agreement. The spokesperson for South Sudanese government troops, Army Geneneral  Lul Ruai Koang, charged that rival forces  known officially as the Sudan People's Liberation Army In Opposition had "declared war" in attacking their positions in Longechuk County located in the Western part of the country. However, Colonel Lam Paul Gabriel, a spokesperson for the rival forces, said government troops attacked first. His group's political bureau on Tuesday had approved the suspension of its participation in meetings of the security mechanisms holding together the peace deal between President Salva Kiir and his rival Vice President Riek Machar. The decision came after government forces were accused of carrying out unprovoked attacks on their rivals' military bases, including cantonment sites, in the states of Upper Nile and Unity. --AllAfrica--
