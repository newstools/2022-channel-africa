The company accused four traders of importing a large quantity of adulterated fuel that several motorists blame for damaging their vehicles. The shortage of fuel has created chaos in Nigeria's main cities, Abuja and Lagos, with queues of cars outside petrol stations stretching for hundreds of metres.

The countries' four oil refineries are either not operating or operating below capacity. --AfricaNews--
