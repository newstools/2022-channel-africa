The World Press Freedom Day is marked annually worldwide. This year’s theme is “Journalism Under Digital Siege”. At the conference in Arusha, discussions will focus on media freedoms in the region, safety issues concerning journalists, and the advancement of big data and artificial intelligence as part of an African media evolution. Particular emphasis will be placed on the subject of media viability in digital times as a route to resilience and the effects that privacy, online surveillance and hacking have on public trust in journalism. According to Deodatus Balile, Chairperson of Tanzania Editors Forum, which is among the organisers, Samia's opening address will form a launchpad for frank discussions on journalism and freedom of expression for sustainable development, as well as digital advancement and associated challenges to gender equality and women’s empowerment in public media and information delivery. --TheEastAfrican--
