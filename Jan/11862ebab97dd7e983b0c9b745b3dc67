However it made little progress in other aspects, such as in the press, where millions continue without access to a free and impartial press and "draconian laws" continue to be applied to persecute journalists. The findings are from the New York-based non-governmental organisation, Human Rights Watch (HRW), and are in its 2022 report, referring to the previous one, released on Thursday. On the positive side, the human rights organisation noted the decriminalisation of homosexual conduct, greater protection of children's rights, the criminalisation of female genital mutilation and sexual intimidation and the expansion of the circumstances under which abortion is legally permitted. However, the report says security forces continue to be implicated in what it calls "serious human rights abuses, including summary executions, excessive use of force against peaceful protesters and arbitrary detentions". Meanwhile, the HRW organisation says that "the human rights situation in Mozambique worsened in 2021, largely due to the ongoing violence in Cabo Delgado province, in the north." In its 2022 report, that New York-based organisation stresses that the humanitarian crisis in that province also worsened due to insecurity and violence, causing the displacement of more than 800 000 people. In that province, the population is assaulted by terrorists and elements of the armed forces.  "The armed group locally known as Al-Shabab or Al-Sunna wa Jama'a, linked to the Islamic State, continued to attack villages, kill civilians, abduct women and children, as well as using children as soldiers in their fight against government forces, " the report reads. And "state security forces were implicated in human rights abuses, including intimidation, sexual exploitation of displaced women and use of force against civilians." --ChannelAfrica/Milton Maluleque--
