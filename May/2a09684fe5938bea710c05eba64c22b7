Germany is hoping to reduce its reliance on Russian energy, following the invasion of Ukraine. Senegal is expected to become a major gas producer in the region. Scholz will also visit a solar power plant there. Germany has invited Senegal, which currently holds the rotating chairpersonship of the African Union, and South Africa to attend the G7 summit it is hosting in June. Scholz will visit German troops in Niger and discuss the lengthy battle against jihadists. Niger has taken on a bigger role hosting European special forces since European relations with the military junta ruling neighbouring Mali deteriorated. --Reuters--
