The 23-year-old centre-back has played for German side Bayer Leverkusen since January 2020, but has been linked with a move to the Premier League. "For a football player the most difficult thing is to stay consistent," he told BBC Sport Africa. "You can play a good game, but you have to be on top every day and that's what I'm trying to do. "It's just giving me pressure, and also the population of Burkina Faso is supporting me very well. I'm always trying to make them proud of me." Aston Villa forward Bertrand Traore is the only player from Burkina Faso to play in the Premier League, but Tapsoba has been tipped to join him in England by those in the West African country. "I think that Edmond Tapsoba is heading in the right direction." journalist Moussavou Billa said. "He has demonstrated all the qualities needed to play at any big club. He delivered with Bayer Leverkusen whether in the Europa League or in the Bundesliga. "Even with the national team he has been a key player. “He could play at Liverpool, Manchester United, or Chelsea, or in any Premier League club. Edmond can become the next big Burkina star in the Premier League." --BBC--
