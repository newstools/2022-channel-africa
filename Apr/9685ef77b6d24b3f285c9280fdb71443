On April 13, Kiir demoted a number of army, police and wildlife service commanders to accommodate Riek Machar's Sudan People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLM-IO) and the South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA). The September 2018 South Sudan peace agreement got a major boost when the stakeholders agreed to unite the armed forces under one command. The decree gives SPLM in government (SPLM-IG) 60% of the armed forces positions, SPLM-IO 27% and SSOA 13%. --The East African--
