Damaris Muthee Mutua, who was born in Kenya but had Bahraini citizenship, was 28. Officers say she'd been stabbed to death. They are searching for her boyfriend, an Ethiopian athlete who police say is a key suspect. Iten is home to a training base for long-distance runners. Tirop's killing there last October shocked the country. Her husband remains in custody and denies murder. --BBC--
