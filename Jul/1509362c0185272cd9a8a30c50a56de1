Mukwege says President Felix Tshisekedi's "diplomacy" is contributing to "worsening instability." "The regional diplomacy of the president of the DRC is objectively leading us towards a prolongation and aggravation of the instability" in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, Mukwege was quoted in a statement. Mukwege made the statement after "the announcement of the deployment of the regional force of the Community of East African States (EAC)" in eastern DRC, where more than 100 armed groups are active. "We are very circumspect" that beyond the partnership with the United Nations Mission in the DRC (Monusco), "Tshisekedi has been engaged in bilateral military co-operation with Uganda for 6 months and, more recently, in a project of regional military co-operation with the member States of the EAC," he said. Mukwege said the "already difficult and ineffective" superposition of these different forces in the DRC "looks like a chronicle of predicted chaos." In mid-June, like many inhabitants of eastern DRC, Mukwege expressed his opposition to the deployment of a "regional force composed of countries at the root of destabilidsation, atrocities, and the looting of our resources," he wrote. In April, the DRC joined Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Sudan in the EAC. Fundamental questions about the rules of engagement of the new regional force, its mandate, objectives, duration, or political and legal responsibilities "are only opaquely answered" because these agreements have been "not very transparent," Mukwege added. For him, "the profound reform of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the security services, and the fight against impunity are the most appropriate measures to ensure pacification and lasting stability in the eastern DRC."  --AfricaNews--
