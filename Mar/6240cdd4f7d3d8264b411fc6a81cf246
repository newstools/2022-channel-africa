In the meeting, Sall requested that the World Bank looks into the possibility of implementing the Bank’s crisis and emergency response policies. The African Union (AU) Chairperson reiterated his request that the institution supports African and other developing countries through the special drawing rights system. The officials discussed challenges and solutions to address water crisis but economic recovery and special schemes for developing countries were per the agenda. "I have suggested that the World Bank looks into the possibility of implementing the Bank’s crisis and emergency response policies. "Its purpose is to support countries facing severe economic crisis, natural disasters and food insecurity. Unfortunately, Africa faces a three-dimensional crisis; the situation could not be more serious, so it was essential that this mechanism be implemented." As the leaders touched on the consequences of the Russia and Ukraine conflict on the global economy, Sall reiterated his request that Africa be granted funds through the special drawing rights system. The special drawing rights system is an international reserve asset, created by the International Monetary Fund to supplement its member countries' official reserves. The international community had agreed to provide Africa with a $33 billion out of a $650 billion post-covid-19 scheme but the AU deemed the amount insufficient. --AllAfrica--
