Muntari hogged the headlines following his move to Ghana Premier League giants, Hearts of Oak, in the 2021/22 season. The former Inter and AC Milan midfielder appeared to be slightly rusty which is rightly so given he last played a competitive match in 2019. However, the 37-year-old’s desire to impose himself on matches has copped praises from advocates of the Ghanaian league. Mosimane who is currently regarded as the best coach on the continent as far as club football is concerned could not hide his delight over Muntari’s move to Hearts of Oak. The three times CAF Champions League winning gaffer believes his return to the Ghanaian top-flight is a step in the right direction, labeling the ex-Portsmouth midfielder as legend. “I saw that the legend is back playing for Hearts of Oak. Ahhhh Muntari, what a midfielder he is. It’s always a pleasure to watch Muntari play,” the South African coach told Joy Sports. Muntari was heavily involved in the Super Clash encounter against Asante Kotoko which ended in a stalemate. He has so far made three league appearances for the Phobians lads. During his time with Inter Milan, Muntari helped the team win the Champions League in 2009–10 and the Serie A title in 2008–09 and 2009–10. He was also part of the Portsmouth team that won the FA Cup in 2007–08. After becoming a full international in 2002, Muntari earned 84 caps for the Ghanaian national team, plundering 20 goals. He featured in two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments and three FIFA World Cups for Ghana. --ghanasoccernet.com--
