National Security Minister Albert Kan-Dapaah warned Members of Parliament (MPs) that separatists in south-eastern Ghana could be planning a new wave of attacks in the region as part of their campaign for a breakaway state of Western Togoland. The authorities also fear ethnic tensions in northern Ghana could be exploited by armed groups to perpetrate violence, and there are concerns that militants could cross over from neighbouring Burkina Faso, where armed groups linked to the so-called Islamic State and al-Qaeda have recently stepped up attacks. Kan-Dapaah told MPs that the country must be proactive in the wake of rising insecurity in West Africa, and said security agencies have been adequately equipped to combat any threats including beefing up security measures along the country’s border with Burkina Faso. Ghana is one of the most stable countries in West Africa but it has several volatile neighbours. --BBC--
