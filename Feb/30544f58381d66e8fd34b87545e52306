Two goals from defender Yasser Ibrahim and efforts from Ahmed Abdelkader and Amro El Soulia saw the Red Devils to an impressive triumph over the Saudi Arabians, who are the reigning Asian champions. Al Hilal had Matheus Pereira and Mohammed Kanoo sent-off in the first-half, but it was still an impressive showing from Ahly, who will hope to return to the next CWC and once again try to bring the title to Africa for the first time. The Cairo club will have their first group stage match in the CAF Champions League on Friday February 18, ironically against Al Hilal of Sudan! --AllAfrica--
