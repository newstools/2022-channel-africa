Local officials say the army came under attack in Bunagana near the Ugandan border. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels, a largely Tutsi militia. The government in Kigali denies this. The Red Cross says in recent days, several thousand people have fled Bunagana into Uganda. The renewed conflict has strained relations between Rwanda and DRC. Over the weekend the United Nation called on all sides to stop the violence. --BBC--
