According to the US ambassador to Uganda, Natali Brown, they want to focus on other pressing needs that affect the population. The US government contributes $400 million annually towards the fight against HIV/Aids in Uganda, but the figure is likely to drop as the US shifts its focus to other priority areas. Brown says: "The goal is to work smarter, more efficiently that doesn't translate into more money and I think one of the important things about, a survey like this, it tells us where to invest more effort, where it makes more sense to direct our resources and attention to make a difference" The move to reduce funding comes at a time when Uganda has registered a slight drop in its HIV prevalence from 6.0% in 2016 to the current 5.5%. However, HIV/AIDS campaigners in Uganda are worried that the reduction in funding could affect access to treatment. Uganda has an estimated 1.4 million people living with HIV/Aids. --Hillary Ayesiga/ SABC--
