Zimbabweans were shocked on Monday when most shops displayed tags on sugar, mealie meal, cooking oil and milk demanding US dollars.

Prices for basic goods, petrol and electricity tariffs increased significantly with inflation nearing 500% as of June 2022 but the government says inflation is 191%.

The move to sell basic goods in the US dollar will spell disaster as most people earn in the local currency, whose strength may be supported by the introduction of gold coins soon.
