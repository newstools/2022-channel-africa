In total, 13 cases have been reported in Lindi region, with patients having symptoms similar to Ebola or Marburg. They have been experiencing fever, severe headaches, fatigue and bleeding, especially from the nose. But the Health Ministry says preliminary lab tests results rule out the Ebola and Marburg viruses in these cases. Contact tracing was ongoing and five people were currently in isolation, it said. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Aifelo Sichalwe, has urged Tanzanians to remain calm as investigations continue. He further urged anyone exhibiting similar symptoms to immediately seek medical attention. --BBC--
