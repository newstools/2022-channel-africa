The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) met with the management team of Comair, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Glenn Orsmond and Ferguson, yesterday. Numsa says it's still not clear if its members will get their salaries for the month of June including medical aid and other benefits. Over 1 000 workers face uncertain future after the airline suspended its operations last week citing financial problems. The union says both the CEO and Business Rescue Practitioner must take full responsibility for failing to turn the airline around. Numsa says in the meantime it will be making an application to the Department of Employment and Labour for employees to be placed on the Training Lay-off Scheme. Union Spokesperson, Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, says whilst the airline is not operating, workers can at least earn some kind of salary while training”. She says at the same time, every effort must be made to find an investor for the airline in order to prevent liquidation.  --SABC--
