Time is fast running out, the UN agency warned, with Somalia facing “the very real risk of famine” in the coming six months. Meanwhile, an estimated 7.2 million Ethiopians are already not getting enough to eat, and half a million Kenyans are just a step away from catastrophic levels of hunger and malnutrition. The Horn of Africa endured drought in 2016-2017, but humanitarian assistance was scaled up early, thus saving lives and averting a devastating famine. Since last year, WFP and its humanitarian partners have been warning that the current drought could be disastrous if the international community did not act immediately. --ChannelAfrica--
