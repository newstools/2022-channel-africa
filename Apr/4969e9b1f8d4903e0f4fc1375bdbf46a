SACC Secretary-General Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana says the council through the KwaZulu-Natal Christian Council (KZNCC) is actively responding to the devastating damage and loss of property and life in the province. Mpumlwana said those who would like to make donations to the victims and affected communities should do so through the KZNCC. “The devastation we have seen the destruction of homes, schools and churches and the loss of lives brings us to our knees as we pray for the safety of the people of that province”. Mpumlwana said as the country celebrates Easter this weekend, the SACC encourages members of the Christian faith to set aside a moment of prayer on Good Friday to pray for KZN and the victims of the floods. “Whether in our homes, or in our religious spaces, let us offer prayers for the province, and those affected by the floods”, he said. 

“Let us pray for safety, pray for the comfort of those who have lost families, their homes and livelihoods. Let us pray in faith, that with the Resurrection of Christ on the third day, the spirit of restoration will wash over the province”, Mpumlwana said.  --SABC--
