The police service is reportedly keen to avoid pay disputes within its ranks. The nationwide recruitment starts on Thursday and will target people with a minimum qualification of D+ in their secondary school exams, a score considered to be below average. "We are advising those with degrees to wait for other positions to avoid labour issues,” John ole Moyaki is quoted as saying. “We are not discouraging graduates from joining the police service, but there are better opportunities and higher job groups that would suit them, apart from the police." Kenya has a long history of police officers using excessive force when enforcing law, often resulting in deaths, but security officers are rarely held to account. --BBC--
