Speaking yesterday during an interview on Deutsche Welle on Brussels, Belgium, Hassan said the diplomatic relations between Tanzania and the EU date back to 1970s. She said the relations are now cordial. “It is true that our relations face some challenges during the past three or four years, but we have sat down and ironed out the differences. They are now back to the same as they were before,” said Hassan. She said with the relations back to normal, the EU has agreed to release $126 million in development funds that had been withheld during the period that the two parties had differed. She said apart from promising to release the funds, the two parties have also signed new project financing agreements. In 2018, the 27-member economic bloc placed Tanzanian development landscape on high-concern state and said it would review its financial support to Tanzania. The announcement triggered a ripple-effect after World Bank withdrew $300 million loan and then Denmark followed by withdrawing $10 million aid. --TheCitizen--
