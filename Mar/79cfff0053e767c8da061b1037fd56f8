President Filipe Nyusi has called for increased alert by the authorities. The cyclone is already being felt with heavy rains and strong winds. Meteorologists expect it to have wind speeds of more than 200 km/h (124mph) and rain above 200 millimetres accompanied by thunderstorms that will last for three days. The provinces of Nampula and Zambézia will be worst hit, meteorologists said. On Thursday, Nyusi said the cyclone could affect over half-a-million people and destroy thousands of schools and hundreds of hospitals "Please refrain from sending children to schools, especially in Nampula, Zambézia and Sofala provinces, until the situation normalises. Please avoid using your cell phone when the phenomenon arrives as it can be a source of an electrical discharge and cause death," he said. --BBC--
