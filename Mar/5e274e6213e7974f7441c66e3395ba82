Mthethwa was speaking at the official opening of the Robert Sobukwe Exhibition in honour of the liberation struggle icon at the Kgosi Mampuru Museum in Pretoria, where he was imprisoned in 1960 for three years by the apartheid government, for inciting a protest against pass laws that led to the Sharpeville Massacre. Mthethwa says the country needs to be mindful of the many facets of Sobukwe’s life such as the fight for human rights and unity. “I can say it without any fear of contradiction or equivocation that Sobukwe would have implored all of us to set this country towards moral regeneration and would have supported our efforts towards social cohesion which seeks to address the historical injustice, breach socio-historical divisions that exist in society today.” --SABC--
