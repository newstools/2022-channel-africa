In a joint report, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch accused Amhara officials and regional special forces and militias fighting in western Tigray of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. They also accused Ethiopia's military of complicity in those acts. An Amhara government Spokesperson told the Reuters news agency the allegations were "fabricated" news. The conflict in the region has killed thousands of civilians and displaced more than a million. --BBC--
