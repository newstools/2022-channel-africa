Addressing a press conference, WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti said "the African continent has gotten smarter, faster and better at responding to each new surge in cases of Covid-19." Since the start of the pandemic, Africa's capacity to manage Covid-19 cases has gradually improved, with the increased availability of trained health workers, oxygen and other medical supplies. However, despite the improvements, oxygen availability remains a concern, and a large majority of patients who require oxygen as part of their clinical treatment plan are unable to access it, according to the WHO. As of February 10, 2022, confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 11 028 833 while over 220 617 343 vaccinations have been administered across the continent. --AllAfrica--
