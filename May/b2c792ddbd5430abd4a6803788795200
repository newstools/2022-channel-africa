Addressing the official opening ceremony of the African Development Bank (AfDB) in the Ghanaian capital, Akufo-Addo says the Russia-Ukraine conflict has made matters worse for African countries. “We are now facing the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and food prices are going up, the crisis is going to affect African farmers.” A critical moment as the African Development Bank Group officially opens its annual meeting in the Ghanaian capital, Accra. There’s a lot at stake as Africa is facing concurrent crises fuelled by rising food prices, surging energy prices and tough financial conditions. Another dominant issue is around just energy transition. South Africa alone requires at least $27 billion to move away from coal-fired power to renewables. The AfDB Group President, Akinwumi Adesina, says they support South Africa’s journey. “The bank is currently working with the Republic of South Africa in support of its just energy transition and we must have an affordable and secure supply of energy.” And fears of a global recession are growing, South African Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, says they are also worried, however, the government will support the most vulnerable. “You would recall since Covid-19 we have done a lot to cushion the vulnerable.” Channel Africa wishes you a happy Africa Day. #WeAllAfrica #MyAfrica --SABC--
