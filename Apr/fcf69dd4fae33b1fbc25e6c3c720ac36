The efforts are largely complemented by the country’s political will involving strategies and policies as well as major developments in storage infrastructure across the country. A recently published third Biennial Review Report of the African Union Commission on the implementation of the Malabo Declaration, shows Tanzania is among countries that are on the right track in curbing post-harvest losses. In the quest to end hunger in the region, governments have committed to cutting post-harvest losses in half by the year 2025. By 2021 Tanzania had successfully reduced losses by 28%, therefore increasing availability and the quality of food without putting additional pressure on the environment and economy to produce more food. Overall, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) indicates that Tanzania farmers lose up to 40% of annual harvests through post-harvest losses. National Food Reserve Agency Chief Executive Officer, Milton Lupa believes minimising cereal losses in the supply chain could be one of the resource-efficient ways that can help to strengthen food security and sustainable measures of combating hunger. --TheCitizen--
