Handing down judgement in this matter, Koen told the court that resorting to an appeal while the matter is heading to trial is not in the interest of justice. Zuma’s legal team filed an application for leave to appeal in January. This after Koen dismissed Zuma’s application for the recusal of lead prosecutor, Advocate Billy Downer. Koen says the criminal trial should start on April 11 as he ruled in 2021. Earlier, some supporters of Zuma, members of his family and former Umkhonto we Sizwe Veterans Association, Carl Niehaus, had arrived at the court. Zuma and French arms dealer, Thales, are facing charges of corruption, fraud, money laundering, and racketeering in connection with South Africa’s 1999 Arms Deal. --SABC--
