Some 92 million African children are working today, more than the rest of the world combined many in slavery-like conditions to survive the poverty and instability that they have inherited. "Our children in Africa need us, Nobel Peace Laureates Kailash Satyarthi and Leymah Gbowee says: "With more than half of the world's child labour in Africa, we call on each of the world's leaders to stand up and act for the rights, dreams and future of our children." The children and young people of Africa deserve the same freedoms and opportunities as those in Europe. This is the simple and non-negotiable principle behind demanding universal social protection for the children of Africa. No more excuses, added Gbowee. Child labour is not a challenge in isolation, but evidence of the greater faults in our global economic, social and political priorities. Child labour and slavery are not only the consequence of poverty, conflict, illiteracy and malnutrition, but are also a cause for the perpetuity of these challenges. According to the International Labour Organisation, Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on children forced into labour around the world, particularly in Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. The situation is aggravated by the fact that Africa has the lowest social protection coverage in the world, and functions that were the least covered include access to education, sickness benefits, benefits for children and families, unemployment protection, and pensions benefits, said a joint statement issued following a roundtable consultation chaired by Gbowee, with a cross-section of leaders from across Africa. --AllAfrica--
