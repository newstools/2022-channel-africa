Israeli newspapers Haaretz and Yedioth Ahronoth published archival material and witness accounts about how dozens of Egyptian troops were killed in Latrun, west of Jerusalem, and buried there. During a phone call, President Abdel- Fattah al- Sisi raised the issue with Lapid who said he had ordered a thorough and transparent investigation and to update Egyptian officials. Egypt was the first country to sign a peace accord with Israel in 1979. --BBC--
