Minister of Foreign Affairs Christophe Lutundula presented the documents to EAC secretary general Peter Mathuki, who described the development as significant for DRC and the community. Member states approved DRC's request to join the bloc in April and the country's parliament ratified the decision in June. DRC's presidency shared the latest developments on Twitter. DRC joins Burundi, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and Tanzania and becomes the second Francophone country in the organisation. The EAC is already engaged in efforts to end violence in eastern DRC, with a regional force expected to be deployed there. --BBC--
