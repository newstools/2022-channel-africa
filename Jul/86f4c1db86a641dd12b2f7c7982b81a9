The reports states that more than half of the projected increases in global population will be concentrated in eight countries, five of which are on the continent. They include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania. The report shows that Nigeria is currently the world's sixth most populous country, and by 2050 is expected to have the same population as the US at 375 million people. That would make it the fourth most populous country in the world. --BBC--
