The group consists of 451 students according to the chairperson of Nigeria’s Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Yusuf Buba, who accompanied them from Romania's capital, Bucharest. Nigeria is expected to evacuate 5 000 citizens who are fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. Many have crossed over to the neighbouring countries of Romania, Poland and Hungary. The repatriation exercise was meant to start on Wednesday but delayed because of logistics challenges. The Nigerians in Diaspora Commission has tweeted photos of the students' arrival at Nnamdi Azikwe international airport. --BBC--
