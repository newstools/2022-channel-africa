The southern Africa country is a deeply conservative society where homosexual acts are illegal. The President is reported to have told the congregation that his position on gay rights had not changed since his days in the opposition. He urged Zambians to "not give attention to things that do not matter". Zambia's constitution identifies the country as Christian. --BBC--
