European countries, scrambling to secure alternatives to Russian coal, imported 40% more coal from South Africa’s main export hub in the first five months of this year than over the whole of 2021, figures obtained by Reuters showed on Wednesday. South Africa’s Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT) delivered 3 240 752 tonnes of coal to European countries by end-May, 15% of RBCT’s overall exports, up from 2 321 190 (4%) in 2021, the figures showed. Starting the second week of August, Russian coal imports will be banned in the European Union, part of wide-ranging sanctions on Moscow. RBCT did not immediately reply to a request for comment. RBCT usually provides figures annually, and does not give a comprehensive breakdown of export destinations. The Netherlands, Italy, France, Spain, Denmark, Poland, Germany, and Ukraine have received coal from RBCT so far this year. Some of them only began importing from RBCT after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The Netherlands received no coal from RBCT in January or February, but imported 1.27 million tonnes of coal from the terminal in March, April and May, with volumes increasing each month. It was the fourth top recipient of RBCT coal, accounting for 5.76% of total volumes.
