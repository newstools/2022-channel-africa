This followed a statement from the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, expressing concern at the Russian decision to recognize the independence two regions that with Moscow's backing has been in a low-level conflict with Ukraine since 2014. Guterres said he considered the decision to be inconsistent with the UN Charter. This was echoed by the UN's Under-Secretary General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary Di Carlo in her briefing to the Council. On Monday, Guterres cancelled his trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. --SABC--
