The AU has not yet released the number of casualties suffered in the attack on the base, which is some 130km north-east of the capital, Mogadishu. But al-Shabab militants say more than 170 soldiers were killed and that they have taken complete control of the AU base. This has not been independently confirmed. In a statement, Faki said the "attack will not lessen the determination" of the AU's force in Somalia. He called on the international community to increase support to the Somali security services and the AU mission. Faki has also had a phone call with Burundi's president to "pay respects for the sacrifice" of the Burundi peacekeepers. --BBC--
