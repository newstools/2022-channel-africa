The union says the minister must present a turnaround plan for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and reverse budget cuts at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). Godongwana is due to deliver his budget speech on Wednesday amid threats of protests by the Economic Freedom Fighters and the South African Federation of Trade Unions. Cosatu’s spokesperson is Sizwe Pamla says, "We were disappointed to hear the President talk about the presidential employment programme with only a target of one million jobs. We are hoping this can be doubled to two million jobs. We would also like to hear about the SOEs as they are leading in destroying jobs in the country." "Not only are they failing to pay their own employees, they are unable to pay their providers. We hope they will present something on how to fund these SOEs and turn them around. We also are hoping they will reverse the devastating budget cuts to the CCMA’s budget," adds Pamla. --SABC--
