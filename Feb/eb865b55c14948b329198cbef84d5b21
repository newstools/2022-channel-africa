The attack occurred in the camp site of the displaced persons in of Plaine Savo, in Djugu, in the Ituri province, North Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Local sources and civil societies incate that several civilians were killed by militias using machettes and spears. According to Ndalo Bise, President of the campa site, the assailants suddenly appeared on Tuesday night from 9pm and started hacking their victims to death. “We counted more than 60 bodies in the shelters for the displaced,” he told local media. Information of the attack is also confirmed by local administrative sources. According to the head of the chiefdom of Bahema N'adhere, at least 63 peoples were killed during this bloody attack. Four more people are reported to still be in hospital. Reports indicate that several civilians have not yet been accounted for. It is believed that an undisclosed number of other civilians were taken hostage by the rebels to an unknown destination. Ethnic violence has ravaged DRC’s North-eastern province of Ituri since in 2017, and is largely blamed on the emergence of Codeco rebel group. Ituri and neighbouring North Kivu province have been under a "state of siege" since May 20221, a measure aimed at speeding the response to armed groups by replacing senior civilian authories with officers from the Congolese armed forces. --Nixon Tasakana/ChannelAfrica--
