Nigerian fans stormed the pitch after The Super Eagles failure to qualify to the Qatar tournament when Ghana clinched the ticket on away goals rule following a 1-1 aggregate score line. Dr. Kabungo was on CAF duty as an anti-doping officer for that match. Government spokesperson Chushi Kasanda said they had been debriefed by the Zambia High Commission to Nigeria that Dr. Kabungo had suffered a cardiac arrest as he was walking to the anti-doping room to conduct random tests on selected players. “The High Commission has further explained that according to the doctors and other officials that were on duty with him at the stadium, Dr. Kabungo had earlier complained of feeling tired,” Kasanda said. “At halftime, he retreated to a room and later returned to the touchline to continue his work. “He collapsed in the tunnel as he was walking to the anti-doping room with some players and officials at the end of the match.” Kabungo was a member of both the CAF and FIFA Medical Committees. He was Chipolopolo doctor from 2005 to 2016 and was part of the backroom staff that won the 2012 AFCON.  --AllAfrica--
