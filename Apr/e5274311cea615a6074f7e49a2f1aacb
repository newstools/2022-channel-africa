The former RB Salzburg star celebrated his 30th birthday by scoring Liverpool’s second equalising goal as they drew 2-2 with Manchester City in a blockbuster Premier League clash last week Sunday. It was Mane’s 16th goal across all competitions in the current campaign and he has played a vital role in helping the Reds clinch this season’s English League Cup (Carabao), while also challenging for the Premier League title, UEFA Champions League trophy and FA Cup. “Everyone who played for us on the day contributed to an important result, but I did want to pick out Sadio,” Klopp told the club’s official website. “It was his 30th birthday on the day of the game and he still looks as fresh and vibrant as when he joined this club as a younger professional. “He is a machine. What he has done for this club and continues to do puts him in the bracket of ‘legend’. For Liverpool and Senegal, he is playing to his highest level possible.” Having joined Liverpool in 2016 from fellow English side Southampton, Mane finished as the league’s joint-top goal scorer in the 2018–19 season, winning the Premier League Golden Boot. “What’s exciting is how he is getting better and stronger. When you see how he looks after himself and his commitment to his profession, turning 30 for him really is only a number,” the German tactician added. “His attitude and character are elite. We are so appreciative of him and I know for sure the levels he reaches at the moment are not the peak – there is, even more, to come from this very special player.” In October 2021, Mane scored his 100th Premier League goal, becoming the third African to reach the landmark. --AllAfrica--
