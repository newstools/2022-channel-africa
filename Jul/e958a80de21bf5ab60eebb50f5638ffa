Formation of the telecommunications-tower company, which follows similar actions by Vodacom's rivals, is not yet complete, Chief Executive Officer, Shameel Joosub, said. Vodacom Group, a SA firm, also operates in other African countries. SA telecoms firms have either carved out tower businesses or sold them to specialist tower companies, a move also seen globally. By doing so, they have raised money for such purposes as funding fast-growing services, such as financial technology. Some have also retained equity in the tower companies. Vodacom's tower company will own more than 9 500 sites, including towers and rooftops, the company said in its latest annual report, published this year. --Reuters--
