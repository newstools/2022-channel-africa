The EU's decision would spur development in Burundi and rejuvenate the integration process within the region, EAC Secretary General Peter Mathuki said. Joint programmes within the regional bloc supported by the EU such as trade integration and governance, peace and security, environmental conservation and climate change would be able to move forward, he said. The sanctions were imposed on Burundi in 2016 following then-President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to pursue a third term in office, which triggered deadly protests. On Tuesday, the EU said that its decision to lift the restrictions was as a result of a peaceful political process that started with the May 2020 elections that ushered in the current president. Nkurunziza died in 2020, weeks after the election of Évariste Ndayishimiye who was his preferred successor. --BBC--
