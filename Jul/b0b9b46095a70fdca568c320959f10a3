People from all walks of life took to the streets in the country ‘s capital city, Maputo, and other towns to protest over the fuel price increments. Motorbike taxi riders, Adissa Adamu and Jawado Anafe, have vowed to increase their fares if their business is to continue to do well. Manager of a gas station, Leo Gasolineira in Lichinga town, Gif Mayopa, attributes the unstable fuel prices in the country to the Russia-Ukraine war which started in February this year. “I appeal to the government to subsidise the cost of fuel,” says Mayopa, “so that people can get a cushion against the high cost of living.” --ChannelAfrica--
