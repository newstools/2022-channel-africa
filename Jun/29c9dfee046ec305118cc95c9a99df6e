Thursday's statement from Dr Lahcen Belyamani, quoted by MAP, said that the monarch would take a few days of rest. The independent English-language website Morocco World News noted that royal doctors were likely to "keep a close eye on the monarch's health", noting his previous heart condition appeared to have "improved significantly over the past two years". The pro-monarchy outlet also noted that Covid-19 infections had risen in the country in the past month from a few dozen cases daily to 1 568 infections recorded in the previous 24 hours. --BBC--
