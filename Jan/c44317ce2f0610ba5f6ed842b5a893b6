The Cape Town-based digital marketing company that has been Twitter’s sales partner in Africa since 2013 believes Twitter’s new investment in parent company Aleph presents an opportunity to grow South Africa and the continent’s digital marketing industry.

“It’s going to accelerate the maturation of our industry [which] is not only about running ad campaigns, but also about the production of great creatives. There are so many opportunities out there that are not as big as they could be simply because there is a shortage of good talent,” Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ad Dynamo Sean Riley tells Moneyweb.

According to Riley, even as a minority stake, Twitter’s investment into Aleph will still be significant given that Aleph is estimated to be valued in excess of $2 billion.  

Twitter will be the first Silicon Valley company to partner with Aleph, which is in a pursuit to upskill emerging economies by providing digital advertising education, training and certification to more than 50 000 professionals in 90 countries.  

“Having Twitter as a stakeholder in Aleph is a particular honour and a special recognition for us. This is a clear endorsement of our efforts in educating a new generation of digital professionals, equally everywhere around the globe,” Aleph CEO and founder Gastón Taratuta said in a statement.
