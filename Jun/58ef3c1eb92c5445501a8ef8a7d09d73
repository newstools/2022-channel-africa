The five, according to the police, had false documents. They included dozens of Mozambican and Kenyan identity cards, passports, as well as asylum application cards and travel documents. The five suspects,  who are currently under police custody,  and their seized documents were presented before journalists on Wednesday. Police are also investigating a network of civil servants who facilitated the group's entry and the issuance of documents.
