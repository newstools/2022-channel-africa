This was announced on Wednesday at an emergency media briefing, shortly after the utility told the South African government that it will be subjected to Stage 4 load shedding until 05:00 on Friday. Thereafter Stage 2 will apply until 05:00 on Monday. Eskom has been in a battle to keep the lights on since the start of the week due to “multiple generating unit failures over the past 24 hours”. At first it anticipated that Stage 2 load shedding, which lowers demand by 2 000 Megawatts (MW), would suffice to stabilise the power system if limited to the hours between 21:00 and 05:00 on Monday and Tuesday night. The situation however deteriorated as more of its poorly maintained coal-fired units tripped.

According to Eskom head of generation Phillip Dukashe the availability of the coal-fired fleet dipped below 60% with more than 20 000 MW out of service.
