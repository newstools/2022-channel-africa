He says some governments on the continent are failing to create jobs, provide adequate healthcare and alleviate poverty. Malema was addressing the media at the party's headquarters in Johannesburg. "We have observed closely that disunity of the continent is being sworn by the former liberation movements through blaming other Africans for social, political and economic ills of our respective societies. "The truth remains that it is the incapacity of regimes which promised liberation to provide adequate healthcare, employment and eradicate poverty which sustains our collective suffering. "It is because of the commitment to corruption and war by those tasked with protecting Africans that we see Africans dwindling into recolonisation."
