Aspen Pharmacare informed the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention it’s concerned about a lack of requests for Covid-19 vaccines and may close that manufacturing line if nothing changes, the head of the African Union’s public health agency said. The continent’s biggest drugmaker is making the doses on behalf of Johnson & Johnson at a plant in South Africa and in March said it agreed to make those shots under its own brand. 

The Durban-based company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The absence of orders comes as countries on the continent left behind in the initial global rollout now have more shots than they have been able to administer. 

Both Africa CDC and the World Health Organisation have called for better coordination of supplies, urging donors to ensure the shots arrive well before their expiry dates so that fewer are wasted. “African countries have been getting a lot of donated vaccines,” John Nkengasong, director of Africa CDC said at a briefing on Thursday. “But if we rely only on these, it will be very short-sighted.”
