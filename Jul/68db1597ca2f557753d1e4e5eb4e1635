Many smaller retail stores are yet to adjust prices. A spot check by the BBC found that shoppers were being limited to purchases of only two packets of the flour, which is used to make the country's staple food, ugali. President Uhuru Kenyatta this week announced that a 2kg bag of the flour would retail at 100 Kenyan Shillings ($0.84; £0.71), a reduction of more than half from a week ago. The government has warned that it will arrest, prosecute, and charge anyone found selling above the set price. Meanwhile, the Minister for Agriculture has told the BBC that millers should expect maize imports from Zambia in days, to help ease a huge shortage. The country has traditionally depended on neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda for maize imports, but the two have turned to the South Sudanese market, which is offering higher prices. --BBC--
