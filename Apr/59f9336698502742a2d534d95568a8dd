Egyptian Al Ahly club are chasing a third consecutive Champions League title and a record-extending 11th triumph in the competition. South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns, one of two sides to go unbeaten through the group stages, have been paired with Angolan side Petro de Luanda in the last eight.

Meanwhile, a Libyan derby between Al Ittihad and Al Ahly Tripoli was one of the stand-out ties in the Caf Confederation Cup quarter-final draw, which was also conducted on Tuesday. Two-time champions TP Mazembe will face Egyptian side Pyramids while 2020 winners RS Berkane of Morocco have an all-North African clash with Al Masry of Egypt.
