His comments come on the back of an announcement that the Zambian Kwacha has been rated to be stronger than the South African Rand and other currencies in the southern African region. The Kwacha has continued to demonstrate its overall stability for a couple of months now. A recent check shows that the Zambian Kwacha is now $1.04 to the South African Rand while one US Dollar is now 16.30 Zambian Kwacha. Zambia’s Chief Government Spokesperson, Chushi Kasanda ,says the Zambian Kwacha is the second-best performing currency after the Russian Rubble, owing to it gaining by over 30% against the Dollar in the last nine months. In an exclusive interview with Channel Africa, Hambai says: “We must turn around the format into a practical return for the benefit of the country. This will speak to a level of consistency that will strengthen the Kwacha for a defined period of time”. Hambai says the level of consistency will help manage macro-economic development in terms of getting an economic recovery. --Channel Africa--
