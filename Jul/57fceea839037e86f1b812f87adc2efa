The group hopes that Alaa Abdel Fattah's "release will indeed be secured soon, and that he will be allowed to travel to the United Kingdom (UK)”. Egyptian Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, will be arriving in London for talks with UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, on either Sunday or Monday. This comes after Truss confirmed to parliament on last month that she “is working very hard to secure Alaa’s release” and would be bringing it up with Shoukry on an upcoming visit to London. Monday will be Alaa’s 94th day of hunger strike. It will also be his sister’s 23rd day of hunger strike. --BBC--
