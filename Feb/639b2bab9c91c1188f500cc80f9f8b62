World Food Programme(WFP)’s head in Cabo Delgado province, Maurício Bortee, held a meeting with local officials on Thursday about the situation. Cabo Delgado has been at the centre of a jihadist insurgency since 2017 that has forced hundreds of thousands people from their homes. “These concerns we have received refer to abuse of power by community leaders or exchange of food for sex,” he said. The WFP had “zero tolerance” for such abuses, he added. “Our aim is to always bring assistance without harming the people we serve and that is why we are here to address these issues, together with all the involved partners.” --BBC--
