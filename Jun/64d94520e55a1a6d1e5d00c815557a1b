The Spaniard’s biggest hurdle in his quest for a record 14th title at Roland Garros was defending champion Djokovic but Nadal overcame the world number one in a vintage quarter-final. Zverev will have a chance to spoil the birthday party for Nadal, who turns 36 on Friday, and victory for the third seed would keep the Olympic champion on course for a maiden major title and the chance to climb to the top of the rankings. In the second semi-final on Court Philippe Chatrier, 2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic and eighth seed Casper Ruud of Norway will slug it out for a maiden final place at Roland Garros. Victory over the 33-year-old Cilic would make Ruud the first player from Norway to reach a Grand Slam singles final. Nadal holds a 6-3 head-to-head record against the 25-year-old Zverev with the Spaniard winning four out of five times they have met on clay. The left-hander, who won the Australian Open in January for a record 21st major title, will be fully focused. “I am not the kind of guy and player that emotionally goes high and low. I am very stable, I think, emotionally,” Nadal said. ‘SUPPOSED TO WIN’ Zverev, who reached the 2020 US Open final, beat a first top-10 opponent at a Grand Slam in 12 attempts when he took down Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz, ranked sixth, in the quarter-finals. “At the end of the day, I said a lot of times, I’m not 20 or 21 years old anymore; I’m 25. I am at the stage where I want to win, I’m at the stage where I’m supposed to win, as well,” Zverev said. Seven-times Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander feels the Parisian weather is going to play a key role. “But, of course, beating Rafa in five sets, there’s a lot more than playing well that you have to do. So, Rafa’s slight favourite in my eyes but hot conditions will favour Zverev I think.” Ruud, 23, will go into his clash with . --Reuters--
