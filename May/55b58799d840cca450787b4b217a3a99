Uber Kenya and Uber B.V. said in an application that an agreement signed between them and the drivers urges them to refer any dispute to arbitration. The Kenya drivers sued Uber in 2016 after it slashed charges as a response to mounting competition from local competitors. The drivers argued that the move was a violation of their rights, as the new rates were below market rates, which would result in killing their business. Documents filed in court state that the initial agreement with Uber was for customers to be charged $0.51 per kilometre with a minimum fare of $3. The deal was also that Uber takes 25% from every trip while the fuel, driver, maintenance and all other related expenses were on the vehicle owner. The Dutch online taxi company, however, says in the latest application that the parties are bound to refer any disputes between them to arbitration in accordance with the agreement. Last year, the High Court dismissed an application by Uber Kenya, seeking the removal of its name from the case, saying they were not party to the contract. Uber Kenya maintained that it is separate and distinct from Uber B.V. --TheCitizen--
