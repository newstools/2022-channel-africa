Reports of the number killed vary from seven to 14. The youths had attended a wedding in Imo state and were on their way home when they were shot, Amnesty said. They were also unarmed, the rights body continued. "Such killings cannot be justified under any circumstances whatsoever,” said Osai Ojigho, the Director of Amnesty International Nigeria. The AFP news agency reports that Nigerian State Security Agency, the Department of State Services, has claimed responsibility, accusing the men of being members of the militant arm of separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra. The AFP also quotes Nigerian authorities as saying the men were armed and opened fire. --BBC--
