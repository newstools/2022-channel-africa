Outgoing President Mohamed Abdullahi "Farmajo" handed over power to Mohamud at Villa Somalia, the presidential palace in the capital, Mogadishu, in a ceremony that was broadcast live on State television. Also in attendance were the senate and lower house Speakers, as well as the armed forces. The official inauguration however is yet to come and is expected in June. Farmajo urged Somalis to work with the new President, and Mohamud has promised to focus on security, national reconciliation and debt relief during his first 100 days in office. It marks a comeback for Mohamud, who served as Somalia's president between 2012 and 2017 before being defeated by Farmajo. --BBC--
