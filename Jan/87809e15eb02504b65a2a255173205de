Harris, the 30th seed, lost 6-4, 3-6, 5-7, 6-7 (3/7) to Australian wild card Aleksandar Vukic, who is ranked 144th in the world. After losing the first set, Vukic held his nerve in a tight encounter on Court 3, winning in two hours and 55 minutes. It continued a good recent run of form from Sydneysider Vukic, who reached a maiden ATP Tour quarter-final last week in Adelaide before losing to eventual champion and fellow Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis. It was a disappointing loss for Harris, whose preparations for the year's opening Grand Slam was disrupted by a positive Covid-19 test in Dubai just after Christmas. It prevented him from travelling to Australia for a warm-up event in Melbourne. The 24-year-old Capetonian eventually recovered to make the trip Down Under where he entered in the ATP 250-level event in Adelaide last week. There he appeared short of match practice, losing 7-5, 5-7, 4-6 in the first round to Korea's 53rd-ranked Soonwoo Kwon. Meanwhile South Africa's other singles hopeful, Kevin Anderson, opens his campaign against big-hitting American and 23rd seed, Reilly Opelka, later on Monday. --News24--
