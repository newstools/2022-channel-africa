This after Zambia became the first country in 2020 to default in the COVID-19 pandemic era, struggling under a debt burden worth 120% of Gross Domestic Product. According to Zambian government 's data its external debt topped $17 billion at the end of 2021, of which a third was owed to China. China agreed last month to co-chair Zambia's official creditor committee with France, a move welcomed by Zambia's government, which has made tackling the country's debts a priority since taking power last year. Emerging market investors and other debtor countries are closely watching Zambia's case for signs of how lenient Beijing will be in the future with overextended borrowers. China became over the last decade the dominant public lender to African countries, extending $160 billion in credit since 2000, according to Boston University researchers.  --Reuters--
