For their part, stakeholders have advised on what the country needs to do to achieve that goal without leaving anyone behind, including setting up an enabling environment for young innovators and start-ups. This was said at the third Innovation and Tech Forum conference organised by Media Convergence in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The event brought together stakeholders from creative agencies, telecoms, innovators and government whose mission was to chart ways in which Tanzania can become a digital hub. The stakeholders also pointed out the existing challenges that the government needs to address, including digital economic policies that will be easily understood by young innovators, but also a need for constant mentorship on digital issues. But, Information and Communications Technology’s PS Jim Yonazi said the government was making efforts including ensuring that communication in the country was facilitated and was accessible to all. “We have ensured that our people have access to communication through their phones and other ICT devices by removing some of the taxes on these gadgets. “This is one of the efforts to ensure that, despite the existence of communication tools, the people themselves are equipped to use them,” he said. He said they want young women to be empowered in the digital economy so that no one is left behind. Regarding the security of the digital economy, Yonazi said that there was specialised training for various government officials with the aim of creating a conducive environment for the digital economy to flourish. Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (Costech) Director General Amos Nungu noted that the government has set up a docket, specifically for telecommunications issues, as one of the strategies to achieve the goal of becoming a hub for digital in Africa. --TheEastAfrican--
