This as the sector is showing steady signs of improvement, after the COVID-19 pandemic decimated it. Tourism authorities have also reported a recovery of 66% for domestic arrivals and 29% for international arrivals at the Cape Town International Airport for December last year compared to 2019, before the pandemic.
