Energy firms are considering projects worth a total of $100 billion on the continent, according to Reuters calculations based on public and private company estimates. African countries that currently have little or no oil and gas output could see billions in energy investments in the coming years, including Namibia, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania. Namibia alone could provide around half a million barrels per day in new oil production, following promising exploratory wells in recent months, according to unpublished estimates by two industry consultants. Africa as a whole could replace as much as one-fifth of Russian gas exports to Europe by 2030, based on estimates by the International Energy Agency. The Paris-based watchdog said an additional 30 billion cubic metres of African gas a year could flow to Europe by then. "As the world seeks to replace Russian oil and gas volumes. The industry is now focusing on the advantaged barrels Africa has to offer," said Gil Holzman, Chief Executive Officer of Canadian oil explorer Eco Atlantic Oil & Gas, which holds interests in oil licenses in nearly 30 000 square kilometres off the shores of Namibia. --Reuters--
