Barely a week after the Kenya Association of Manufacturers warned that most of its members are facing challenges accessing the dollar, Pwani oil, the manufacturer behind the Salit Oil, Mpishi Poa, and Fresh Fry cooking oil products has announced a temporary halt of its operations citing dollar shortage which has hindered it from sourcing key commodities. Concerns are now being raised that the dollar shortage in Kenya could trigger job losses as more manufacturing firms may be forced to shut down or suspend operations as they try to navigate cash flow problems. Kenya is already battling rising inflation which has heightened the cost of living with fuel and food prices rising. According to the Stanbic Bank Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), Kenya's business confidence hit a record low for the third month running in May with the PMI index dropping to 48.2 from 49.5 in May.  --AllAfrica--
