Analysts yesterday warned that motorists could be looking at further record-high fuel price increases for April, due to supply constraints as the government dithers over easing fuel prices. The oil price jumped early yesterday to its highest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis, with Brent crude briefly touching $139 a barrel before slipping back below $130 on supply fears. In a note, economists from the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) led by Hugo Pienaar, yesterday said the local impact of the extraordinary oil price gains was signalling that domestic fuel prices could increase by as much as R2 a litre in April. “Depending on oil price moves in the rest of the month, the increase could be significantly more than R2/litre,” BER said. “This follows a hefty petrol price hike of about R1.50 per litre in March.” The United States is in active discussions with European partners about banning Russian energy exports, which could tilt the scales as Russia exports about 4.5 million barrels of crude a day. The oil price escalation was exacerbated by delays in the potential return of Iranian crude that could bring about 500 000 to 1 million barrels a day to the global market. In 2008, demand destruction occurred when the Brent crude prices hit $147.50 in July 2008, shortly before the global financial crisis. However, Exinity Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed said the current spike in prices was not a demand-driven shock, but a supply-driven one, and there was no ceiling in sight. Sayed said sanctioning Russian oil posed serious negative consequences for the global economy. --IOL--
