The league added that the figure increased to 92% when vaccination rates among club staff were added to that of players. The numbers show a slight increase since the last set of figures were released in December, in which 84% of players had received a dose of the vaccine. "80% of Premier League players have received two doses of Covid-19 vaccination and therefore are classed as fully vaccinated under government guidance," the league said in a statement. "The league continues to work with clubs to encourage vaccination among players and club staff, as well as promoting the government's public health vaccination messaging. "No specific details as to clubs or individuals will be provided by the league." Manchester City are planning as if their FA Cup tie at Swindon will go ahead despite a coronavirus outbreak at the Premier League club. City currently have 21 members of their “first-team bubble” isolating after testing positive for Covid-19, including manager Pep Guardiola and seven players, following a raft of fresh cases this week. The league also reported 11 new infections of Covid-19 in the previous week, continuing a downward trend in the number of positive cases for a fifth week. However, the league only administered 1 947 Covid-19 tests between January 24 and January 30, as opposed to 6 221 in the preceding week, with the Premier League on break. --Reuters--
