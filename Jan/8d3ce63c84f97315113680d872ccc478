Cross-border movement of people and goods at the Gatuna/Katuna border was barred over tensions between the two East African nations. Only goods were allowed in through the other two borders, Cyanika and Kagitumba. The reopening was announced after President Yoweri Museveni's son Lieutenant General Muhoozi Kainerugaba met President Paul Kagame in Rwanda. Rwanda had accused Uganda of arresting and deporting its citizens and supporting rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). The Ugandan government denied the allegation and instead accused Rwanda of infiltrating its security agencies. Uganda on Tuesday sacked the head of military intelligence Major General Abel Kandiho who had been accused of human rights abuses. The reopening of the main border and the sacking of the official has been seen as a move to better relations between the two countries. --BBC--
