The 19th edition of the multi-sports Games, second in size only to the Summer Olympics, was scheduled to take place from September 10-25 in the capital of Zhejiang province, some 175 kilometres southwest of Shanghai. Question marks had been raised over the event taking place with Shanghai having recently been locked down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. The local organising committee did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The decision to postpone the Games was taken at a OCA executive board meeting in Tashkent on Friday. Most international sporting events in China have been postponed or cancelled since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the notable exception of the Winter Olympics, which went ahead in Beijing under strict health controls in February. --Reuters--
