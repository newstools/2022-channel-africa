De Beers Group, Anglo American’s diamond business, is one of the world’s leading diamond miners alongside Russia’s Alrosa. “I don’t see a reason to think there will not be decent growth medium- to long-term in the diamond industry. I feel more positive about the future than I have done for a long time,” Bruce Cleaver said on the side-lines of a diamond industry conference in Dubai. “Supply will remain stable. It won’t fall off a cliff. We see 20, 30, 40 years of stable supply. That’s why I feel quite positive,” he said, adding that supply probably peaked in 2018-2019. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the global diamond supply chain, with some mines shuttered, rough diamond trade plummeting and polishers in India leaving their jobs. In the second quarter of 2020, De Beers sold around 3% of the rough diamonds they would normally, Cleaver told the conference, partly because concerns about miners working closely together limited production and partly because buyers anticipated lower consumer demand as economies slowed. --Moneyweb--
