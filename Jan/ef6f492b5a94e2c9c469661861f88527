Teaching was supposed to start on January 10, but this has been delayed to January 24. "The reason is that although we were prepared as a ministry for the re-opening of schools, the upswing is a danger," Minister of Education Douglas Syakalima is quoted as saying on the CGTN news website. The government plans to use the period to implement protocols including deep cleaning of school premises, according to the same site. Teachers have welcomed the decision, saying it will give schools time to put in place proper precautions to make sure staff and pupils are safe, according to Zambia’s ZNBC news website. --BBC--
