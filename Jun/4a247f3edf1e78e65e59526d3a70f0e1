A gold-crowned tooth is all that remains of Lumumba who was shot dead by a firing squad in 1961 and his body dissolved in acid. The plane carrying the coffin will land in the capital, Kinshasa, from Brussels, where the former colonial power returned the tooth to Lumumba's family. The coffin will then tour the vast country, including the village where Lumumba was born, before the tooth is taken to a newly built mausoleum in Kinshasa. The tour is expected to be emotionally charged, according to the AFP news agency.
