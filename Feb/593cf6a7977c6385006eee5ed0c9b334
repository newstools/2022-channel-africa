Both grades of petrol will increase by R1.46 per litre while diesel goes up between R1.44 per litre and one R1.48 per litre. The Automobile Association of SA Spokesperson, Layton Beard, says fuel price increases will have an immediate impact on the poor as well as a long-term effect on inflation. “The impact certainly is dramatic and salaries and wages have not been keeping pace with the increase. This massive increase is going to put more strain on other things as well. E-tolls are getting expensive, electricity, and everything in general. The fact is that there are many millions of South Africans who are already struggling financially and this is going to be an extra burden on them.” --SABC--
