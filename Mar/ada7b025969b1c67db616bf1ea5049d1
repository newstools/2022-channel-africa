Unicef estimates that 147 million children have missed at least half of their in-person schooling. It says some vulnerable children, especially girls, have not returned to those schools that have reopened. Unicef Executive Director, Catherine Russell, says children are "the hidden casualties of the pandemic". While children have been less vulnerable to the most serious health effects of coronavirus, their lives have been turned upside down by the school closures of the pandemic. In March 2020, 150 countries around the world completely shut their schools, with partial closures in a further 10. Two years later, 19 still have some of their schools closed. In a further four, the Philippines, Honduras, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu in the South Pacific at least 70% remain shut, the proportion Unicef categorises as full closure. "We're seeing children go back who were reading before, who now can't read, who were doing numbers before, who now can't do that," Russell told BBC News. It is across sub-Saharan Africa that reading, writing and maths skills were lowest even before the pandemic, according to Unicef. When schools reopened in Uganda, in January this year, about one in 10 pupils failed to return. Extreme flooding had also damaged many school buildings, so Unicef has provided 457 high-performance tents. --BBC--
