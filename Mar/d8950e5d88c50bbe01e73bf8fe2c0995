Mnangagwa made the remarks during the virtual meeting with nearly 50 diplomats in the capital Harare. Although Zimbabwe and other countries in the Southern African Development Community region could be facing similar climate change problems, Mnangagwa said his country needs help. While the country now has a climate change policy aimed at strengthening adaptation strategies, funds remain a challenge. Zimbabwe has been badly hit by effects of climate change resulting in droughts and deadly cyclones. While addressing diplomats in Harare, Mnangagwa remarked that climate change was ravaging the country. “The negative impact of climate change remain worrisome, to this end my government remains committed to increase collaborations and partnerships at both bilateral and multilateral levels to increase climate knowledge, improve adaption capacity, and reduce over reliance on climate sensitive sectors”, said Mnangagwa. He further said that his administration continues to administer climate change adaptation and resilience into national policy across all levels. Mnangagwa warned foreign funded organisations to stick to the mandates they would have been allowed to operate in the country. “We remain careful with regards to various development partners who are assisting us. “It is imperative that government, development partners and community based organisations alike work in unison with greater transparency and accountability for the good of the beneficiaries”, Mnangagwa added. Despite political challenges and sanctions imposed against members of Mnangagwa’s cabinet, he emphasized that foreign investment is safe in the country. --John Cassim/Channel Africa--
