The streets of downtown Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, may not be the place you want to take a deep breath. Air pollution is increasing, caused mainly by motorcycle taxis, also known as bodaboda. In 2018, the number of newly-registered motorcycles, commonly used as taxis or boda boda, was estimated at 1.5 million. Joyce Msuya, the Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme believes the figure "will likely grow to five time million by 2030." Cut the smog Swedish-Kenyan electric vehicle group, Opibus, is at work to cut the smog. In a Nairobi-based workshop, engineers convert motors with a combustion engine into electric motorcycles. "Uber provides obviously a lot of boda boda riders, that’s our target client, Alex Pitkin, Opibus Chief Technology Officer say. They often don’t know how beneficial electric motorcycles can be in terms of money saving, safety, fuel savings, maintenance savings…" The developing climate crisis is fuelling concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and the world is looking for solutions towards a net zero economy. Once seemingly farfetched in the developing world, clean mobility is quickly becoming a priority here according to Lucy Mugala, engineer at Opibus. "Targeting Africa and African countries is also part of that movement, and as Opibus, that is where we are targeting. “We want all of us to move together. We all move towards a greener energy, a greener economy. And we can only do that if we all come together and empower and build capacity locally." With up to a third of the country’s population suffering from respiratory ailments exacerbated by poor air quality, electric mobility brings hope of both health and wealth for the country. --AfricaNews--
