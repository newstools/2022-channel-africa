Dos Santos died two weeks ago in Barcelona, Spain at the age of 79. The court also decided to delay the handover of his body to his family, a court spokeswoman said on Monday. "Despite the fact that the provisional autopsy the report indicates that Dos Santos' death was natural, and the court has decided to order complementary testing to that usually done in an autopsy, given that a complaint about possible threats to this person was previously filed," she said. The Carmen Varela family law firm representing Dos Santos' daughter, Tchize dos Santos, said she had asked for a full autopsy due to alleged "suspicious circumstances of his death", though neither the law firm nor the daughter provided evidence of such circumstances. --Reuters--
