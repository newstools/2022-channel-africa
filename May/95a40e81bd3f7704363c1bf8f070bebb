The suspected cases, who are under health care and monitoring, are in good health, the ministry said in a statement. The ministry established that the three patients have undergone medical tests, pending results. Over 12 countries have confirmed or reported on suspected monkeypox cases. Over the weekend, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that about 12 countries confirmed 92 cases and 28 suspected cases. The countries where the outbreak of monkeypox was confirmed include Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. WHO said the situation is “evolving,” expecting more cases to be identified. Monkeypox, which is identified as a rare disease by experts, was first discovered in the 50s. Cases in humans were recorded in the 80s, however. The virus was predominantly contracted through contact with wild and dead animals. The symptoms of monkeypox include fever, intense headache, back pain, low energy, swollen lymph nodes, and a skin rash or lesions. Symptoms last between two days to a month. The symptoms “can go away on their own without treatment,” according to the WHO. On the probability of fatalities due to the virus, WHO said that while the symptoms can go away on their own, “in some individuals, they can lead to medical complications and even death.” Newborns, children, and people with weak immune systems can be at risk of “more serious symptoms and death from monkeypox.” --moroccoworldnews.com--
