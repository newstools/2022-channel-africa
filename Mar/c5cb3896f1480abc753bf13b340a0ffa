In June 2020, the stores occupied 440 000 square metre (m2), with a projection then that this would decline to 382 000m2 by June 2023. 

Last week, the group said it sees this number declining to 357 000 m2 – 7% more than it had originally anticipated. It sees this number declining even further by June 2024, to 354 000 m2.

It is highly likely that the cuts will be even more aggressive. In a footnote for the first time Woolies says “these projections are linked to contractual agreements and do not reflect negotiations to reduce space currently in flight”. 

In other words, these are the baked in, signed and sealed reductions already agreed with landlords. Since Chief Executive Office Roy Bagattini’s arrival, the group has been actively managing its trading space in microscopic detail to drive profitability per square metre.
