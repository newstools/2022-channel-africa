The Kenya Transporters Association (KTA) says the delays in fine collections for offences at weighbridges by the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has seen many end up with accumulated bills that are hefty to pay later. The transporters said trucks are allowed to continue operating and committing multiple offences over several years without notifying drivers or the truck owners, only to get demands running into millions of dollars. “KTA is not advocating for breaking the law. But it is unfair and unjust to suddenly receive three-year-old multiple fines for several offences that were not brought to our attention when they were committed, hence they continue to recur,” said KTA Chairperson Newton Wang’oo. “Trucks that have passed through virtual weigh-in-motion weighbridges and have committed offences are not charged immediately,” he added. He said some of the offences may have been committed without the driver’s knowledge. The transporters said they have written several letters to KeNHA about the issue, but no action has been taken. They said KeNHA has weighbridge stations all over the country with electronic systems. The transporters proposed waiving of all offences committed and have taken more than a month before notifying the owners of the trucks, and recommended that penalties be charged immediately they offences are committed. Wang’oo proposed that all offences of less than a month be immediately notified to the transporters. --TheEastAfrican--
