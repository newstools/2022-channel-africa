Egypt raised the price of diesel on Wednesday by 0.50 pounds ($0.026) to 7.25 pounds ($0.38) per litre following a quarterly review, as well as announcing a rise in petrol prices for the third time this year. Since 2019, the pricing of fuel has been set under quarterly reviews that take into account global markets and the exchange rate, after Egypt phased out subsidies on most fuel products under reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Egypt has been under new financial pressure because of global price increases in commodities including wheat and oil that accelerated after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. --Reuters--
