Gordhan says these include the quality of coal, the purchase that takes place at power station level as well as quality of maintenance at technical level. The Minister says good managers who try to challenge these practices are often threatened in various ways in order to intimidate them. In a written response to a question from political opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, Gordhan says in its current state, it would be challenging for any executive to turn around Eskom and that the current leadership should be given as much support as necessary. Gordhan says that lack of maintenance of coal plants has resulted in high unplanned plant breakdowns that are causing power cuts. He adds that the loss of valuable skilled members of the operational team through the harassment and victimisation of competent engineers by the previous management has made matters worse. The Minister said the tentacles of the corrupt former managers continue to reach into Eskom and doing everything to undermine the work of the current leadership.  --SABC--
