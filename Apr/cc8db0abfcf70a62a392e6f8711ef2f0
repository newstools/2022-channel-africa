Applause erupted in the courtroom as the long-awaited verdict was read out, bringing the curtain down on a case that has afflicted the impoverished and volatile state for 34 years. Sankara's widow, Mariam was also present during the ruling. Mariam hailed the verdict as true justice. "I think that the Burkinabe people and public opinion now know who President Sankara was, who the individual was, who the politician was, what he wanted, what those who assassinated him wanted. “In any case, I am relieved because we know who he is. He had been called everything in speeches and all that, now we know that he was a man of integrity." One of the prosecution lawyers Prospère Farama beamed with smile at the verdict. "Yes, justice has been done. For the people, because it's been 34 years of struggle of a people. “We must not forget; it's been 34 years that the Burkinabe people have been fighting against impunity. And with this case, I think that it is a great victory..." Farama told reporters outside the courtroom after the verdict. The court also issued life terms to Hyacinthe Kafando, an officer suspected of having led the hit squad, and General Gilbert Diendere, an army commander at the time of the assassination, which coincided with a coup that brought Compaore to power. Eight other accused were given jail terms ranging from three to 20 years, while three defendants were acquitted. --AfricaNews--
