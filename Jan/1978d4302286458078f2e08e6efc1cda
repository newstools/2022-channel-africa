CAPAH National Coordinator Shiyama Kutoha says the event dubbed Expo Kabompo will take place in two Provinces of Western and North Western Zambia that share marine resource of the mighty Zambezi River, whose source is Kaleni Hill in Kabompo. Kutoha says the idea is to show investment opportunities that has remained un exploited in agriculture, tourism, mining, restocking of wildlife and promotion of fishing sports available in the two provinces. “The Western province of Zambia shares borders with Angola and Namibia, while Northwestern Zambia shares borders with Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo”, says Kutoha. “From this expo, the Zambian Chapter of CAPAH is hoping to arouse enough interest from international investors, especially from neighboring states that could lead to increased trade and collaboration in Africa”.
