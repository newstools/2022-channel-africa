The state-owned Somali National television said the river had “dried up” and it could exacerbate the drought situation in the country and further increase food insecurity. The Shabelle river flows into southern Somalia from the highlands of neighbouring Ethiopia. It is second biggest river in Somalia and is a major source of water for residents in the south and central regions. Agricultural activities in the country have been affected by a fourth failed rainy season. More than five million people are reportedly at risk of famine as a result of a severe drought affecting the country.
