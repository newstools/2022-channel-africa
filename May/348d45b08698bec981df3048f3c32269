Messi earned $130 million, a figure which includes $55 million of endorsements, during the 12-month period ended May 1, 2022, to sit atop the list of the 10 highest-paid athletes a year after finishing second to Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor. Los Angeles Lakers forward James was next on the list after bringing home a combined $121 million shattering the $96.5 million record for an NBA player that he set last year, while Portugal captain Ronaldo earned $115 million to sit third. Brazilian soccer player Neymar ($94 million) and three-time NBA champion Stephen Curry ($92 million) of the Golden State Warriors rounded out the top five. NBA player Kevin Durant ($91 million) was sixth while Swiss tennis great Roger Federer, who played five tournaments in 2021 before a knee operation curtailed his season, was third with total earnings of $90.7 million. The final three spots on the list went to Mexican boxer Canelo Alvarez ($34 million), seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady ($31 million) and reigning NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo ($30 million). Forbes said its on-the-field earnings figures include all prize money, salaries and bonuses earned during the 12-month period while off-field earnings are an estimate of sponsorship deals, appearance fees and licensing income. --Reuters--
