Antoinette Monsio Sayeh, the IMF's Deputy Managing Director, will lead the two-day visit.

According to a statement released by the Zambian Finance Ministry on Monday, the Deputy Managing Director will meet with President Hakainde Hichilema, as well as the Finance Minister and Central Bank Governor.

IMF approved a $1.4 billion bailout for Zambia in December, but the three-year agreement was conditional on the government's commitment to deep economic reforms.

The country is seeking to expand its meeting with its creditors in order to unlock funding and restructure its $17.3 billion debt.
