Colonel Assimi Goïta said he was willing, in the spirit of good relations between Mali and Ivory Coast, to work to resolve the dispute, including through diplomatic means. He said this would be in strict compliance with Mali's sovereignty. An official statement on Monday said Goïta wished that Togo leads the mission between the two countries to help resolve the situation. This came after he held talks on issues of common interest with Togolese Foreign Affairs Minister Robert Dussey. He praised Togo’s support and the personal commitment of Togolese President Faure Gnassingbé to Mali's political transition. Ivory Coast has been calling for the immediate release of its soldiers, who it says were unjustly arrested but who Mali said it considered mercenaries. Ivory Coast said its soldiers were in Mali to support the UN mission, known as Minusma, under an agreed contract between the two countries. --BBC--
