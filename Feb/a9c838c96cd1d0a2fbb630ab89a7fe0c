The CBK’s most recent currency printing contract, awarded to British security printer De La Rue in 2018 for the new generation banknotes, was worth $85 million over three years. The initial batch of the notes, delivered in 2019, cost the monetary regulator $19 million, with additional printing expected to fill the full quota and replace worn-out notes. The savings, the CBK added, would however be weighed against the additional administrative costs it would incur to manage the virtual cash, known as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). “CBDC has the potential to reduce the cost of printing money. However, it introduces the production costs, fixed and variable, of running CBDC infrastructure,” said CBK. Most of the investments in the CBDC would, however, come up at the setting up stage, and it would likely be cheaper to administrate in the long run compared to hard currency which requires regular replacement due to wear and tear. The government also recoups some of the cash printing costs through its 40% stake in the British multinational’s local subsidiary, De La Rue Kenya EPZ Limited, which prints notes and other security documents at its facility in Ruaraka.
