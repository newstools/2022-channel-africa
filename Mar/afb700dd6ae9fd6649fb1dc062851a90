Amnesty’s report underlines that the "police violated the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful demonstrators faced arbitrary arrests and detentions." Economic and social crisis and human rights violations fuelled the "increase in protests across the country", while "security forces intensified operations across the country aimed at preventing demonstrations". A note of emphasis goes to pastoralist communities who have had their land expropriated for commercial agricultural use and, while AI says, "the government has responded inadequately to ensure food and water for victims of land expropriation, drought and displacement". The provinces of Cunene, Huila and Namibe continued to face extreme weather conditions symptomatic of climate change and "prolonged drought resulted in food and water shortages". The human rights organisation concludes that "consequently, many people and livestock died, while others sought refuge in Namibia". --ChannelAfrica--
