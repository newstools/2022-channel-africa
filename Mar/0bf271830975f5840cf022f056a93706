The amount is 27 000 tons more as compared to 13 000 tons passing the part, therefore increasing revenue four times. Yesterday, TPA acting Marketing Manager Lydia Malya said that the agreement will enable the cement production industry to transport cement and clinker used as raw materials for cement production within and outside the country. “Through the agreement, cement will now be transported to other parts of the country via the Mtwara, Tanga, Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar ports. Likewise, the product can be shipped further afield outside the country,” she said. Malya, who was speaking on behalf of TPA Director General Erick Hamissi said the main objective of the agreement was to attract the company’s use of the port that would not only attract other users, but also increase government’s revenues. Mtwara Port Manager Kalembwe said since most company’s customers are cantered at the business capital of Dar es Salaam to other parts of the country including Kigoma the distribution through the ocean would be reliable for availability of cargo, hinting that the move will reduce the products prices. Furthermore, he said before the agreement the plant transported cargo to Zanzibar, Comoro and Northern part of Mozambique at an average of 13 000 to 15 000 tons through the port. “The volume of cement that was passing the port remained relatively low compared to the plant production volume. Therefore, following this beginning, we expect more from the company and other stakeholders,” he said. Dangote Cement Company Limited, produces 1.5 million tons of the product annually, however the factory’s installation capacity is three million tons per year. Mtwara Regional Commissioner Marco Gaguti said the agreement will definitely open economic opportunities in the region. --TheCitizen--
