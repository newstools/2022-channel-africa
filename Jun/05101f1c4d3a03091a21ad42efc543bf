The Tanzanian government is accused of violently seizing 1 500 sq km of land in Loliondo in Tanzania’s Ngorongoro district. This is despite the East African Court of Justice's 2018 injunction against the state evicting the community. Last week, several people had to seek medical treatment after sustaining wounds during clashes with the police. Tanzania’s government has denied the use of violence and excessive force by police in what it has termed a land-marking exercise. It also said no-one was being evicted from the area. Authorities have designated the land for hunting. --BBC--
