The flooding has devastated the province's roads, bridges and houses after five months of rain fell in just three days. State-owned logistics company, Transnet, says the Durban port has been closed until further notice due to the environmental damage caused by the flooding. Roads leading to the terminals are badly damaged and cannot be accessed. A shipping container warehouse near a busy highway was severely flooded, and hundreds of containers were washed away by the raging waters. The city of Durban has become the epicentre of the unfolding natural disaster which is fast escalating to a humanitarian crisis. Pats of the crucial N3 highway which connects Durban to the economic heartland of Gauteng has been blocked off. Communications have also been disrupted. Two major telecoms companies have reported over 900 of their cell phone towers were down. The county’s President, Cyril Ramaphosa, has cut short a trip to Mozambique to visit affected areas to assess the damage. --BBC--
