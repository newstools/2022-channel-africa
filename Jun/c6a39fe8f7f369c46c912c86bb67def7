In a tweet, Minister Jane Aceng did not offer the latest figures on confirmed cases, but said the country was "well prepared to respond and save lives than before". She also ruled out travel restrictions or lockdowns in any parts of the country under the current circumstances. "We will optimize the existing control and mitigation tools at personal and community levels. "These measures include: vaccination for all individuals, wearing of face masks at all times especially for the vulnerable population and, hand washing," she said. Uganda fully reopened the economy in January after imposing one of the world's strictest lockdowns during the pandemic, which saw schools remain closed for almost two years. --BBC--
