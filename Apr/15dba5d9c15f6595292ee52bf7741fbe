Kenya has only had four presidents since it gained independence from the British in 1963. Some are remembering him for fostering unity as well as the high economic growth that Kenya experienced after he took over as President from 2003. The opposition ODM party tweets that he will be "remembered for initiating economic and infrastructural transformation and ensuring the completion of the constitution reforms process". "Kibaki was the best President that Kenya ever had. The funniest and a performer. He had his shortcomings but the man gave Kenya the best," one social media user says. "I shall miss the great economist who knew what was best for Kenya. He didn't use billboards, portals, websites and social media to claim credit. His work was and will remain visible for generations to come," another says. While many people are praising Kibaki's legacy, not all are remembering his best moments. Edwin Omari says Kibaki’s lowest moments remain the post-election violence of 2007-2008, "that almost dismembered Kenya as a state". Saddique Shaban says the former President has died with secrets of the post-election violence. More than 1 000 people were killed and hundreds of others displaced in the aftermath of the violence. --BBC--
