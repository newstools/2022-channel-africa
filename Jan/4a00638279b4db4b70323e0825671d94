The extension will last until February 18, according to the Tunisian official gazette. Saied had extended the state of emergency before, on July 24, for six months, ending on Wednesday. Tunisia had first announced the state of emergency in 2015, following a terrorist attack. Since then, it has been extended by authorities. Under these measures, the Interior Ministry is granted emergency powers to stop meetings and gatherings, impose curfews, and clamp down on media organisations. According to rights groups, these restrictions constitute violations of human rights and widespread abuses. --MiddleEastMonitor--
