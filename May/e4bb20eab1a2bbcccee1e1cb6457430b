Speaking in Parliament, Energy Minister January Makamba said President Samia Suluhu’s administration is also in the final stages of securing loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to help ease the high cost of living, worsened by increasing petroleum prices. Simmering public outcry over the high cost of fuel, which has caught the attention of top politicians, prompted a flurry of meetings involving the President, the Prime Minister, Ministers of Energy and Finance, the taxman and officials from the petroleum agencies. The government also plans to allow more private oil companies to import fuel directly. “Energy ministry has completed the evaluation of all companies that have shown that they can deliver fuel at lower prices in a bid to ensure the security of supply,” noted Makamba. According to the ministry, the government will establish a Fuel Price Stabilisation Fund to cushion consumers from the otherwise high prices amid rising crude oil costs. Tanzania will also set up a large fuel depot and National Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Currently, the country has oil to last 27 days, Makamba said. --TheEastAfrica--
