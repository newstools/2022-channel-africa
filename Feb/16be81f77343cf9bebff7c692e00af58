President Cyril Ramaphosa is now expected to decide on whether Supreme Court of Appeal President, Mandisa Maya, should be appointed for the position. The JSC has recommended that Ramaphosa appoint her, with three other candidates also vying for the job. Mpofu says Ramaphosa could choose any one of the four candidates, but his decision must be rational. “Legally, he could do it, but we are living in a constitutional democracy so whatever decision he takes must be rational. Strictly speaking, he is the appointing authority and the checks and balances in the Constitution compel him to consult with us, as he has done, and also with leaders of political parties. After those consultations, he has to apply his mind and make the appointment.” JSC recommends Maya as the next Chief Justice The JSC has recommended Maya as the next Chief Justice. This was just announced in a short statement by Commissioner Dali Mpofu, during a media briefing, which happened five hours later than the initially stated time (1pm). The deliberation started at 9am on Saturday morning, following marathon interviews with the four judges tipped for the position. During her interview by the JSC for the position of the country’s top judge, Maya called for government to give women and black lawyers the experience required to become top judges. She reflected on the under-representation of women at all levels of the judiciary and says the quality of future judges is dependent on giving them exposure currently. --SABC--
