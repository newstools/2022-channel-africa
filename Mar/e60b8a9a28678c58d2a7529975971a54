The 31-year-old two-time Olympic 800m champion produced a superb run in the 3000m at the Athletics South Africa Grand Prix at Green Point Athletics Stadium on Wednesday that had the boisterous crowd cheering her every step. Semenya clocked a new personal best of eight minutes 54.97 seconds  the sixth-fastest by a South African and beat her previous best of 9:04.20 in cold, windy conditions. The SA 3000m record of 8:32.00 was set by Elana Meyer in 1991. It was more of a training run for Semenya as she is preparing for the 5000m at the SA championships next month, also at Green Point, where she will hope to better the qualifying time of 15:10 to make it to the Eugene, Oregon, world championships in July and August. “We must just be prepared, especially because we will be doing the 5km, maybe the 10km, we don’t know,” she said. The three-time world champion still has a case at the European Court for Human Rights as she is challenging World Athletics regulations for DSD (differences in sexual development) athletes, which prevent her from racing her preferred distances (400m to one mile). But coaching has become her new passion, having established the Masai Athletics Club in Pretoria a few years ago. “My focus is to be here to help my athletes, so that they can be better. My coaching is my primary goal at the moment, and being able to plough back to the athletes and work on the foundation, so that I can change lives.  --IOL--
