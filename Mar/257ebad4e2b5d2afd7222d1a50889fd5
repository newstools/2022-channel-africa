It’s alleged that the company was used as a front to get kickbacks in exchange for lucrative government contracts. Former Bosasa Chief Operation Officer, Angelo Agrizzi, testified to this, implicating Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe and former Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane before the State Capture Commission. He’s subsequently been accused of offering gratification, on behalf of Bosasa, to former Member of Parliament Vincent Smith in exchange for his influence. The final report is expected to be handed over to Ramaphosa the end of April. Last month, African Transformation Movement  leader, Vuyo Zungula slated the Zondo Commission for its request for an extension to finalise the State Capture Commission of Inquiry report, saying the request put Zondo’s administration and competency under the spotlight. Zungula said at the time he hoped that was not meant to influence the outcome of the appointment of a new Chief Justice. The commission gave various reasons for the delay, including Raymond Zondo’s appearance before for the Judicial Service Commission. “The Acting Chief Justice, Zondo is bringing his administration and competence into question given these delays. “You would remember that when the commission had sat, it had received timeous extensions in order for it to complete its work. Now that its work is completed, we see another trend of reports being delayed when it comes to being issues to the public. We hope this is not the manner upon which the Acting Chief Justice is trying to influence the sitting President as Chief Justice of the country,” said Zungula. --SABC--
