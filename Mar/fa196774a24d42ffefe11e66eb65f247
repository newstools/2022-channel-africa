A Ministry official termed it as a second chance to the students, although there was no clarity on how transfer of grades will be done. The announcement came as some 23 students arrived home on Sunday. It is unclear if the evacuation was done on a return ticket to allow the students to return to Ukraine after the war. African students who were studying in Ukraine had said that they were uncertain about the fate of their education. Some countries like Ghana have agreed with Hungary to have some Ghanaian students who had fled Ukraine allowed to complete their studies in Hungarian universities. They will provide space and resources and the students will pay the same fees as in Ukraine. --BBC--
