There may be some relief for consumers, should Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana and his Mineral Resources counterpart, Gwede Mantashe, signal an intervention amid the expected full return of the general fuel levy. It is estimated that the total increase for petrol is expected to be over $0.24 per litre, and diesel by $0.23 per litre, starting tomorrow. Automobile Association's Spokesperson, Layton Beard, says the cost of living is going to increase. “It's going to be the same thing that we have seen over the last couple of months. “The increase is going to have a severely negative impact on all consumers, especially the poorest of the poor”, said Beard. Cost of living problems are being seen across the world where fuel prices are increasing. Beard added that places like America and Europe are experiencing significant increases and South Africa is not isolated in that regard.  --SABC--
