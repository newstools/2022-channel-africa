"We are counting on a massive adhesion because the teachers are the ones who are tired and asked for this strike, to complain about this inertia", said trade unionist Jorge Cardoso, speaking to Lusa today. The President of Sindep points out several situations of alleged non-compliance, namely reclassifications from 2016 to 2021, subsidies for not reducing the workload from 2017 to 2022, or lack of publication of retirements, but also the freezing of wages since 2016. On Friday, with the mediation of the Directorate-General for Labour, teachers' union representatives still tried a last understanding with the Government before the strike, but without success. "Nothing came out of the meeting. The strike will go ahead," said the President of Sindep, which has around 4 000 affiliated teachers. Cardoso recalled that Wednesday's protest, which includes, besides the national strike, demonstrations on all the islands - the main one is scheduled for after 09:00 local time in front of the Government Palace in the city of Praia - represents a "class struggle for the definitive resolution of these problems. --ChannelAfrica--
