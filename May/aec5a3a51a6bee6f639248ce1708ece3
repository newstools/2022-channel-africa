Gordhan was replying to questions in the National Assembly of Parliament on Wednesday afternoon. Gordhan also spent much of his time in the plenary defending Transnet's partnership initiatives with the private sector to develop infrastructure and extend the Durban harbour in a $7 billion project, which will increase container capacity from 2.9 million units to more than 11 million units. The ruling African National Congress Member of Parliament, Nkosinathi Dlamini, asked how private partnerships would assist with protecting freight rail infrastructure. Gordhan said Transnet, the department, and law enforcement were discussing what could be done to improve security. "There is absolutely no doubt that copper theft and rail theft and vandalism having a disastrous effect on logistics in South Africa. “We are working with the police to ensure that special teams are established to understand who is behind it," said Gordhan. The Minister said the Department of Public Enterprises was working with the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition to figure out ways to discourage the continued theft of infrastructure, including the possibility of banning the sale of scrap metal temporarily. --News24--
