NUMSA said on Monday it had provided a 48-hour strike notice, in line with labour regulations after mediation efforts failed. The labour union sought an across-the-board wage increase of 10%, a housing allowance, and an 80% medical aid contribution from the employer, among other demands. Africa's biggest steel producer ArcelorMittal Ltd has only offered 5% across the board, as well as cash incentives. --Reuters--
