The side will be Africa's sole representatives at the tournament, which will take place in Sydney, Australia, in September. D'Tigress have climbed a place to 14th in the Fiba world rankings following their showing at the World Cup qualifier in Belgrade earlier this month. The African champions recovered from their opening day defeat to China by beating world number five France and continental rivals Mali to pick up the last available ticket on offer for Sydney. Despite missing France-based point guard Ezinne Kalu, Amukamara joined top performers Adaora Elonu, Amy Okonkwo, Victoria Macaulay and Oderah Chidom in posting stellar performances to seal back-to-back appearances at the World Cup for Nigeria. "This tournament was very special for us. We battled through a lot of adversity," Amukamara told the Fiba website. At the 2018 World Cup in Spain, Nigeria posted the continent's best performance as they exited the tournament in the last eight. The draw for the 2022 World Cup will take place on Thursday, March 3 in Sydney. The second side to win three African women's basketball titles in a row, Nigeria have the credentials to back their claim as one of the continent's giants. However, the leadership crisis within the Nigeria Basketball Federation overshadowed the team's preparations ahead of the qualifying tournament in Serbia. For Africa's other representative, Mali, it was an opportunity lost to make history and reach the main event for the first time. --BBC--
