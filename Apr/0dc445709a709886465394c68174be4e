Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana told local television station that an initial $68 million for emergency relief was available for immediate use, local authorities have estimated the damage at several billion rand and that more would follow. This week’s floods in KwaZulu-Natal Province have knocked out power lines, shut down water services, interrupted operations at one of Africa’s busiest ports and strewn highways and beaches with debris. “We are still at an emergency relief stage. There is a need for speed in this matter,” Godongwana said. “The first phase is to get professionals to make an assessment of the damage and the cost. The second phase is going to be a recovery and repair.” Local TV stations carried footage of volunteers cleaning up plastic containers, piles of bamboo and driftwood from Durban beachfront. Ministers were arriving in Durban on Friday to assess the damage.

Local climate campaigners are calling for greater investment into adaptation to help communities better prepare for weather shocks.
