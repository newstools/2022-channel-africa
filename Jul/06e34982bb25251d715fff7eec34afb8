The measure aims to deal with the rising cost of living that has seen prices of basic commodities soar. A 2kg (70 oz) packet of maize flour will now retail at $0.84 instead of $1.77. Critics say the President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, is using the measure to influence the choice of his successor in the August 9 elections. Kenyatta has rejected the accusation and said the price rises themselves were political. "It is shocking to politicise the misery of the vulnerable. It's more distasteful to gain political capital out of the sufferings of the vulnerable, without offering solutions," he said in a speech. His government has blamed external factors, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for affecting the prices of fuel and food. Annual inflation hit 7.9% in June, with the cost of basic commodities such as food and non-alcoholic beverages rising by 13.8% during the same period, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Most Kenyans determine the state of their lives by one thing: the price of basic commodities. The majority of households equate that to the cost of a 2kg packet of maize flour in the shops. Maize meal is the key ingredient for "ugali," a local delicacy and staple food. It's therefore not surprising that a directive to lower prices by Kenyatta on Wednesday created a buzz in the mainstream media and on online social media platforms. Kenyatta noted that the new prices had been achieved after days of negotiations between the government and the maize millers. His government has proposed to suspend a railway development levy charged on imported maize and the import declaration fee to achieve the new prices. But the subsidy is not new. In 2017, the ministry of agriculture contracted nine millers to lower the cost of maize meal. However, the deal fell through after the millers accused the government of failing to pay them. --BBC--
