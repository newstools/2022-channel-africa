The four-time and reigning African Women's Footballer of the Year had her tournament ended by a medial ligament injury suffered in Nigeria's 2-1 defeat by South Africa (SA) on Monday. The 27-year-old recently won Spain's Pichichi award after scoring 20 league goals for Barcelona and was expected to help the Super Falcons defend their continental title in Morocco. Oshoala suffered the injury in the early minutes of the Group C clash, but played on for another hour before she was substituted in the 82nd minute of the game. Scans revealed Oshoala suffered a grade two medial collateral ligament injury and will be returning to Spain on Thursday, according to the Nigeria Football Federation. One team official said the injury would sideline the former Arsenal and Liverpool player "for several weeks". Oshoala's injury leaves Nigeria with a 24-player squad as they seek to bounce back from their opening game loss against SA. Botswana lead Group C on goal difference ahead of South Africa, with both sides in action again on Thursday against Nigeria and Burundi respectively. --BBC--
