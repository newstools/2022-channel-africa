The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) says it is not happy to see Jawar Mohammed, of the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), pictured with its flag on his recent tour of Europe. Jawar, a popular opposition politician who was released from prison in January after 18 months behind bars, has not commented on the row. Speaking to the BBC, OFC leader Merera Gudina tried to down play the OLF's concerns, saying it was not a big issue. --BBC--
