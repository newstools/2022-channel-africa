He was paying tribute to South Africa’s men and women in uniform during the celebrations of Armed Forces Day in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. Ramaphosa lauded SANDF for its role in battling the insurgency currently taking place in the north of Mozambique. "These brave men and women are there to restore stability and prevent a spill-over of the conflict into other countries in our region. Last month we welcomed back the members of the 15 South African Infantry Battalion from their deployment to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since 2001, members of the SANDF have been part of peacekeeping operations under the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, known as MONUSCO," said Ramaphosa. --SABC--
