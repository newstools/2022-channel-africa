There are reports that one civilian was shot dead in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital, Khartoum, where the demonstrators advanced towards the gates of the presidential palace. A doctors' organisation linked to the protest movement said dozens of people had also been injured. At least 84 people have been killed by the security forces since a coup in October ended a power-sharing agreement that was to lead to elections. --BBC--
