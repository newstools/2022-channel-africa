This follows a media statement by the public broadcaster's board on Friday that the SABC was losing revenue due to the planned switch off of all analogue transmitters at the end of the month to migrate to digital Television. According to the board, the migration presents a risk to the SABC' turnaround plan and will deprive millions of people of public television services. Ntshavheni says it contradicts information presented in the SABC quarterly performance and turnaround plan Implementation reports. Ntshavheni says she will write to Parliament to withdraw all the SABC's quarterly performance reports submitted under her signature as they are based on inaccurate information. In the March 27 letter to the board, bearing her signature, the Minister expressed her disappointment that “the SABC board has chosen to respond to my letter dated March 24, 2022, through a media statement”. --SABC--
