The union will also march to the Treasury and the province’s Department of Health to hand over a memorandum of grievances. Denosa says this follows months of non-payment of some post-community service nurses, non-absorption of community service nurses and failure to fill vacant nursing positions by the department. The nursing union says the march will also demand the immediate removal of Gauteng Health’s Chief Financial Officer, Lerato Madyo. --Channel Africa--
