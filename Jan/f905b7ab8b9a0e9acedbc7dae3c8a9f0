The Extraordinary Summit will among other things review progress and mandate of SADC Mission in Mozambique (SAMIM). Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera who is Chairperson of the SADC bloc has called for the meeting. According to a statement, Chakwera is expected to chair the summit which will at the end chart the way forward on how countries within the SADC are going to deal with the conflict. The extraordinary SADC Summit will be conducted virtually due to continued spreading of Covid-19 cases. In Malawi, close to 2400 people have died because of the Covid-19 pandemic since 2020. The summit, according to Chakwera, will help review progress and the mandate of the SADC mission in Mozambique. Rwanda from the East African Community bloc is the country which sent troops to Cabo Delgado early last. The Rwandan soldiers have so far helped to cool down the situation despite that there is a recurrence of the fighting. Malawi and other SADC countries have not sent troops to Cabo Delgado to help quell the fighting, which has seen some civilians flee and seek refuge in Malawi’s lakeshore district of Mangochi. During the SADC summit when Malawi was chair of the bloc, no much was discussed about sending troops to that country. Few Presidents from the bloc were in attendance as most of them preferred attending it virtually. With Mozambique’s President Felipe Nyusi testing positive to Coronavirus, it is unlikely that he will attend since he is on a 14 day self-isolation with his wife. Chakwera is chairing the 16 Member States organisation for a term of one year since August 2021. Malawi has hosted various meetings of technocrats, ministers from the bloc since the country was ushered into the SADC office. Due to this, Malawi was also chosen as one of the partners to the Government of the United Kingdom to lead other Least Developed Countries in the Adaptation and Resilience Coalition under the United Nations frameworks.  --Channel Africa--
