This comes amid indications, from the Central Energy Fund, that South Africa could be hit with significant increases in petrol and diesel prices in the first week of June. Adding to the fuel price hikes is the full return of the GFL, which government cut by $0.095 per litre for two months. The total increase for petrol and diesel is therefore expected to be over $0.24 per litre. OUTA's Chief Executive Officer, Wayne Duvenage, says they have asked Godongwana to continue with the reprieve. “He did reduce the fuel levy to ease the pain on the public but the new petrol price hasn't eased off, it is going up again”, said Duvenage. Duvenhage said if the Minister increases the fuel levy or brings back the fuel levy reprieve, it is going to go up substantially from its current levels. “We are going to hit $1.60 and that is going to be devastating for the economy”, he said.  --SABC--
