The government on Monday said the deadly incident followed skirmishes between Sudanese soldiers and a local militia on Ethiopian territory. Sudan had accused the Ethiopian army of capturing seven of its soldiers and a civilian and later executing them. But Ethiopia claims a Sudanese unit, supported by Tigray rebels, had staged an incursion into its territory, resulting in the skirmishes. Farmers and pastoralists often clash in the fertile porous border region of al-Fashqa, claimed by the two neighbouring countries. Addis Ababa said Sudan misrepresented the facts and “unjustly put the blame on Ethiopia,” the Foreign Affairs ministry said in a statement it issued Monday afternoon. Ethiopia says it will investigate the incident. Khartoum is reported to have filed a formal complaint with the United Nations Security Council. --TheEastAfrican--
