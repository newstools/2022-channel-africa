The UN and the province's Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform have agreed to Co-operate to upscale local farmers to produce food to be sold to the UN. The Head of Department, Siphokazi Ndudane, says this project will boost rural economies and improve the local value chain in agri-processing. The Regional Director of the WFP, Menghestab Haile, says his team is experienced with this type of programme. He says they did it in Eswatini and Lesotho 10 years ago through a South African government funded project. Conflict and insecurity are the main drivers of hunger, and in Ukraine, their combination is causing the fastest-growing humanitarian crisis in the world. “It is a very complex situation with too many ramifications,” explains this humanitarian who has worked in conflicts for the past two decades. And the problem is by no means limited to having people trapped in the east of the country without access to food. In January, before the war in Ukraine had started, the latest Hunger Hotspots report produced by WFP and its sister agency the Food and Agriculture Organisation, painted a grim outlook for Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Yemen, where humanitarian assistance is critical to prevent starvation. --SABC--
