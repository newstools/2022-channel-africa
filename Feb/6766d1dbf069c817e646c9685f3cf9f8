Russia’s internet censor also escalated pressure on the tech companies, as protesters used social media to voice opposition to the war and organise. A Twitter corporate account on Saturday tweeted that their service was being “restricted for some people in Russia”. A Twitter representative declined to comment on whether Russian authorities gave the company a reason for the shutdowns. “We believe people should have free and open access to the internet, which is particularly important during times of crisis,” the company’s public policy account tweeted. Tech companies long have positioned themselves as beacons of free expression, and democratic standards. But the war in Ukraine is testing those values in new ways. From the halls of Congress to the Twitter feeds of pro-Ukrainian activists, the companies are facing increasing clamour for a tougher line on Russia, which itself is renowned for using popular technology to influence geopolitics, most infamously in the 2016 United States presidential election. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Digital Minister, on Friday sent a letter to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, calling on him to stop supplying products and services, including the App Store, to Russia. Fedorov suggested that such a move would motivate young Russians to “proactively stop the disgraceful military aggression. We need your support, in 2022, modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple rocket launchers and missiles,” he wrote. He also tweeted early on Saturday that he had contacted Facebook’s parent company, Meta, along with Google and Netflix, asking them to suspend services in Russia. He called on YouTube to block “propagandist” Russian channels. Social media platforms particularly have come under scrutiny for their role in promoting Russian state media. --IOL--
