The protests were organised by the civil society group, NDSCI. On Monday, the Chairperson of the African Union, the Senegalese President Macky Sall, telephoned the Rwandan and Congolese leaders to try to ease tensions between Kigali and Kinshasa. Both sides accuse each other of supporting rebel groups in eastern DRC. Sall had earlier expressed "grave concern" at rising tensions between the two countries. He appealed for dialogue to resolve the dispute. --BBC--
