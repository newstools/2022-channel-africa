The All Basotho Convention (ABC) announced that it’s pulling out of the government shortly before Finance Minister Thabo Sophonea was set to deliver the annual budget on Wednesday in the capital, Maseru. Lawmakers prevented Sophonea from speaking by insisting that the government had collapsed, though the speaker of parliament has yet to make a declaration on the matter. The ABC has been riven by divisions since a party vote last month in which former Health Minister, Nkaku Kabi, was elected as leader. He defeated Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro, who said that he wants to remain prime minister until the country holds general elections in September. --News24--
