On his arrival in Luanda, the Cape Verdean statesman was received at the Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport by Angolan Foreign Minister, Teté António, amongst other entities. The programme of the visit includes official talks between delegations from both countries, at the Presidential Palace in Cidade Alta, and an extraordinary plenary session of the National Assembly, during which the Cape Verdean head of state will make a speech. It foresees equally a displacement to the Memorial António Agostinho Neto, to deposit a crown of flowers in the sarcófago of the first President of Angola. Before returning to his country, Neves will meet the Cape Verdean community living in Angola and visit the Agostinho Neto University Campus and the National School of Administration and Public Policies in Luanda. --Phil Nelo-ChannelAfrica--
