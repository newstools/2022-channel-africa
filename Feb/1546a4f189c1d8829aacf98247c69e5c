The Mauritian ambassador to the United Nations led a ceremony on the island of Peros Banhos, where a pre-recorded message from the Mauritian Prime Minister was played through a loud speaker. Another flag was raised on the island of Salomon. The islands are controlled by Britain but claimed by Mauritius. The flag-raising was the culmination of a trip organised by the Mauritian government, which included a group of Chagossians evicted from the islands by the British government 50 years ago. --BBC--
