This comes after the commission recommended that domestic worker salaries be increased to 100%- of the National Minimum Wage (NMW). While this increase for domestic workers will certainly have a positive impact on their livelihoods, households, and financial well-being, the critical question is, are South African households financially ready for the increase in domestic worker salaries? The adjustments follow recent proposals published by the NMW Commission which recommend that domestic worker salaries be increased to 100% of the NMW. Under the Act, the minimum wage for domestic workers was initially set at 75% of the NMW in 2020. The Commission proposed increasing it to 88% of the national minimum wage in 2021 and 100% in 2022. Workers employed as part of the expanded public works programme are entitled to R12.75 per hour. In terms of the law, it is an unfair labour practise for an employer to unilaterally alter hours of work or other conditions of employment in implementing the national minimum wage. The NMW is the amount payable for the ordinary hours of work and does not include payment of allowances such as transport, tools, food or accommodation payments in kind board or lodging, tips, bonuses and gifts. The increase comes at a time when South Africans facing increased costs led by a combination of local and international factors.
