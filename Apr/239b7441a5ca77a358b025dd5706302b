The industry is expected to post an annual average growth rate of 5.8% from 2022 to 2032 versus the 2.7% increase in global GDP, and create 126 million new jobs, WTTC said in a report released during the industry group’s conference in Manila. In 2019, tourism accounted for a tenth of global GDP and jobs but the coronavirus pandemic decimated the $9.6 trillion industry, halving its output value and leaving 62 million people jobless. “The recovery is going to be so stellar that it’s going to recover really powerfully. This does depend of course on China reopening,” said WTTC President Julia Simpson, calling on all governments to reopen borders. China’s “zero Covid-19” policy and persistent lockdowns have disrupted global trade and domestic and international travel. The travel and tourism industry’s GDP is seen hitting $8.35 trillion this year and $9.6 trillion in 2023, a return to its pre-pandemic level. Tourism jobs are projected to recover to 300 million this year and 324 million in 2023, close to the 333 million seen in 2019, WTTC said. --Moneyweb--
