Many of the Ethiopians from the Middle Eastern country are undocumented migrant workers who have been detained in squalid conditions. More than a week since the drive began close to 5 000 migrant workers have been returned, according to a statement from Ethiopia's women and social affairs ministry. In a campaign that could take up to 11 months, the authorities have pledged to bring a 100 000 Ethiopians home from Saudi Arabia. The returnees are provided with temporary shelters and medical support upon arrival. However, it is not clear if they will be offered a sustainable means of getting income once they settle in. --BBC—
