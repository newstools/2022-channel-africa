ACSA Chief Executive Officer Mpumi Mpofu met with executives from various institutions including railway company Transnet, Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, the Central Energy Fund, and the Mineral Resources and Energy Department to find solutions to mitigate challenges of fuel supply at the airport this week. Last month ACSA announced that it was facing jet fuel supply constraints in the wake of floods in KwaZulu-Natal province which destroyed rail infrastructure and caused logistical problems. Mpofu said a number of flights were also cancelled due to the fuel shortage. “The one airline cancelled seven daily flights for a week but are now operating. “And the second one did the same from May 1, so a total number of 14 flights were cancelled during this period and that covers 3 150 passengers who have been impacted”, said Mpofu. ACSA said the country's jet fuel supply is currently stable.  --SABC--
