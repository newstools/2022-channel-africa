The committee is expected to make its rate announcement this afternoon. A Chief Economist at Efficient Group Dawie Roodt says he expects the Reserve Bank to increase rates to help to cushion middle and low income countries from the impact of rising rates in developed economies. Today the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), Lesetja Kganyago, will announce the decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on repurchase rate (repo rate). This will be the first interest rate announcement for the year. The announcement will come at the back of 2021 inflation rate averaging at 4.5% and December 2021 consumer inflation peaking at historic 5.9%. The dominant sentiment is that SARB should closely monitor inflation and hike interest rate as inflation is on the upward trend. --SABC--
