All-rounder Stokes, 30, has scored 5 061 runs and taken 174 wickets in 79 Tests and had been vice-captain across two spells since 2017. Batter Root, 31, stepped down after five years in charge, having led England in a record 64 Tests. Stokes' first Test as permanent England captain will be against world champions New Zealand at Lord's on June 2. He previously captained England in the first Test defeat by West Indies in 2020 when Root missed the match to attend the birth of his second child. Stokes also led the one-day international side to a 3-0 series victory over Pakistan last summer after a Covid outbreak forced England to name an entirely new squad. He took a break from cricket in July for his mental wellbeing and to allow a finger injury to heal but returned to the England squad for the Ashes series. Following England's tour of the West Indies in March, Stokes has been suffering pain in his left knee, but is hoping to make a return for county side Durham in May. New Managing Director of England men's cricket, Rob Key, has appointed Stokes as captain in his first major act since taking over the role from Andrew Strauss, who had stepped in on an interim basis following the sacking of Ashley Giles in February. --BBC--
