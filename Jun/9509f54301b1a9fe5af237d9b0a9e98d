Health workers union Zimbabwe Health Apex Council (ZHAC) said while it knows the strike could mean human cost, they cannot report for work because remuneration of healthcare workers is presently so poor that most health care workers can no longer afford the service they provide nor are they able to look after and fend for their families. The economy has been in a tailspin for the past three months with the Zimbabwe dollar's weakening resulting in 132% inflation. Over the weekend, government offered its employees a 100% salary increment, which meant the lowest earning government worker would take home an equivalent of R1 600($100). They flatly rejected the offer.In April 2018, Zimbabwe's health and childcare minister, who is also the vice president, retired army general Constantino Chiwenga, fired 16 000 striking nurses. His iron fist approach, according to ZHAC, was hostile to the point that there has never been a meeting between him and health sector representatives. In the past three years, ZHAC said at least 4 000 government healthcare workers have resigned from work. The majority went to the United Kingdom. "The poor conditions of service have caused significant brain drain within the health sector, with more than 4 000 resignations in the last three years," it said. According to figures from the Health Service Board, in 2018 about 756 health workers resigned. In 2019, 767 left, and in 2020 a reported 993 health workers quit government employment. In 2021, while there was no industrial action from health workers, another 2 246 resigned.
