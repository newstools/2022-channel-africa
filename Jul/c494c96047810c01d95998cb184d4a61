The leaders committed to take action to keep adolescent girls in school, which will dramatically reduce their vulnerability to HIV. The initiative calls for free and quality secondary education for all girls and boys in sub-Saharan Africa by 2025, universal access to comprehensive sexuality education, fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and rights; freedom from gender-based and sexual violence; school-to-work transitions, and economic security and empowerment. “My government has committed to the provision of free primary and secondary education for all,” said Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema. “Education is the greatest equalizer and with appropriate education, everyone is given an opportunity to explore their full potential and be able to participate in the development process. “Access to education empowers both girls and boys as it enhances their ability to access decent jobs and other means of production thus alleviating poverty,” he said. --Channel Africa--
