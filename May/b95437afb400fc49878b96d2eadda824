At least 2000 delegates from over 180 countries are attending the 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour, which South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, has opened at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban. It’s the first time that the conference is being hosted in Africa. Wissing stressed on the importance of proper labour practices as well as the need to ensure parents are employed to help eradicate child labour. “We need to make sure that the parents have a decent income, decent work and they have access to a job that provides a sufficient family income. “We need to make sure that workers can defend their rights. We need to make sure that they have social protection and that the worker’s rights are respected. “We need to make sure that the parents are really the ones that are receiving the family income and that jobs are created. I think that at the end of the day it has very much to do with creating the conditions to prevent the children from being trapped into child labour.” --SABC--
