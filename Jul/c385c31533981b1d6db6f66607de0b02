Esther Lungu is wanted for questioning by the Drug Enforcement Commission in connection with 15 flats she owns in Lusaka. The commission alleges that the properties may have been dubiously acquired. She has denied the allegations. Addressing lawmakers for the former governing party, Lungu said his family was being unfairly targeted.  “You don't have to be very intelligent to know that after Esther it's me. So this is a sequence, it's like peeling the onion so I am ready," Lungu said. His Patriotic Front party last year lost power to incumbent Hakainde Hichilema of the United Party for National Development. Several former government officials have been appearing for interrogation with some of their property seized as part of the new government's fight against corruption. --BBC--
