She says the scrapping of the rotational timetable, which was implemented due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, had already been gazetted. The move comes after a cabinet decision at the end of last month to end rotational learning with immediate effect and to remove social distancing measures. Cabinet’s announcement followed a meeting between the President’s Co-ordinating Council and the National Coronavirus Command Council. Addressing the media in Pretoria on Sunday, Motshekga outlined the schools’ immediate priorities. "The first step towards addressing the crisis of learning is to prevent further disruptions in schools and prevent other learning losses when dealing with health and safety issues in our schools. The second step will be to introduce measures to catch-up on the time lost as well as the teaching time lost. We urge parents and all our stakeholders in the sector, to support efforts to ensure that education continues without any further delay." Motshekga says that learners will still be required to wear their masks to prevent the spread of the virus. --SABC--
