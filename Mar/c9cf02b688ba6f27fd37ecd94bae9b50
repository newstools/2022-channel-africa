President Uhuru Kenyatta unveiled the multi-billion Shilling facility at Dunhill Towers in Westlands, Nairobi. In a statement sent to the newsrooms from State House, the Head of State expressed optimism that the facility will bolster the government’s push to secure high-tech jobs in the digital space for the youth. “As a premier centre of research and development for Microsoft, we all remain confident that you, together with our young men and women, will build a local world-class talent and create innovative technological solutions that will yield global positive impacts,” Kenyatta said. The facility will house the research, design, engineering, and innovation teams as well as the Microsoft Garage, an incubation hub launched as part of the on-going efforts to scale tech innovation on the continent. The centre is one of the largest software engineering facilities in Africa and sets the standard for a new generation of technology hubs across the continent. Kenyatta said that Microsoft has also partnered with local universities and start-ups to provide training and skills to create job opportunities for over 200 000 young Kenyans in support of the digital economy. The investments in the centres are part of Microsoft’s on-going plans for enabling digital transformation, bridging gaps in infrastructure, connectivity and capability while creating sustained societal impact on the continent. --TheEastAfrican--
