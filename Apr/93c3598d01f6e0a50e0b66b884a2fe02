Reports say some of the victims were sleeping in a small mosque within the gas station in the town of Marke when the fire broke out and engulfed the building. Regional Police Spokesperson, Lawan Shiisu Adam, says the incident happened late on Monday evening and that the victims were aged between 15 and 35. Some witnesses say a gas cylinder exploded at the petrol station igniting huge flames. The authorities say they’re investigating. Nigeria has frequently seen such explosions involving petrol stations or tanker trucks, mainly blamed on disregard for safety measures, leading to loss of lives and property. Last week at least six people died in the commercial hub of Lagos when a tanker-truck loaded with petrol had a head-on collision with another lorry carrying cement causing a massive explosion and huge fires on a major highway. --BBC--
