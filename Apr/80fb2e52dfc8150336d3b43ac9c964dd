The independence-era ruling party says Nkrumah wasn't given a fitting burial by the state following his death in April 1972, and that his "soul was still restless". Nkrumah died 50 years ago while being treated in Bucharest, Romania, and was buried in his Nkroful village in southern Ghana. His remains were later transferred to a mausoleum in the capital, Accra. The CPP party said it would soon unveil a timetable of activities that would culminate into Nkrumah's "actual funeral". It did not offer details whether it plans to exhume and rebury Nkrumah's remains at another site. Local outlet Joy News has published a video of the remarks by the party's General Secretary Nana Yaa Jantuah on the proposed reburial. --BBC--
