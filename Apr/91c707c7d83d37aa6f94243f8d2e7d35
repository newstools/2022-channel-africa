Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) confirmed on Wednesday that extensive damage was caused to its plant at Prospecton south of Durban, after flooding this month left a trail of destruction in the province.

Production at the plant has been suspended since April 11 and TSAM has not yet given an indication of when it will resume. “Plant activities have been suspended while assessment and clean-up takes place. The cessation of operations will be extended when the plant enters the reparation phase,” it said. “The damage caused to the TSAM facility has not yet been fully quantified. A more accurate forecast concerning the resumption of production will be provided once assessments are completed.” TSAM said that from a sales perspective, this natural disaster has impacted its immediate ability to deliver vehicles. It did not specify how many vehicles will be scrapped. The plant produces the Hilux, Corolla Cross, Quest, Hiace Ses’fikile and Fortuner. TSAM senior vice president of sales and marketing Leon Theron said customers whose vehicles were destroyed will be prioritised.
