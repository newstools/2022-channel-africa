It says its generation system is “severely constrained”. This load shedding warning comes after the utility suspended the latest round of load shedding on Friday, which spanned almost a week. According to the latest alert issued by Eskom on Monday, the loss of multiple generation units during the weekend, together with delays it experienced with returning some units to service is what is currently putting pressure on its systems. “Eskom is working on returning a generation unit each at Matimba, Duvha and Arnot power stations to service before the evening peak,” Eskom said. Eskom further notes that it will be tapping into its emergency reserves to meet the electricity demand. --Moneyweb--
