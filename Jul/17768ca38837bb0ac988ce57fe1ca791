The Kenyan government says 4.1 million people in the East African nation are food insecure, up from 3.8 million in March this year. Power told a news conference in Nairobi that the amount was in addition to the $65 million that USAID had already provided this year. She said the war in Ukraine was increasing suffering in Kenya and the rest of the region. Margaret Kobia, a Kenyan Minister responsible for public service, gender, senior citizens' affairs and special programmes, said the government had so far spent 12.6 billion Shillings ($106.28 million) to help people affected by drought but had a shortfall of 15 billion Shillings ($126.3 million).  --Reuters--
