The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture handed over the report to the Presidency on Friday. The report has explosive revelations into State Capture. It covers corruption and fraud in the public sector including organs of state. The report lays bare former President Jacob Zuma’s alleged direct involvement in Eskom’s affairs in a well-orchestrated plan to capture the state-owned power utility. It indicates that Zuma, the Guptas and their associates were behind the suspension of many Eskom executives holding strategic positions to make way for those who would comply with their demands. The SIU Spokesperson Kaizer Kanyago, explaining their plan of action, says, “For us, we want to make it very clear, it’s a whole societal approach. We need to get all the stakeholders including civil society to be part of what we do, so that we can strengthen the areas of prevention because when the corruption has already happened, it becomes a difficult exercise to deal with those issues. From our sides, we’ll make sure that the assets are recovered. Where officials decide to resign, we will freeze their pensions and when it’s time to recover, we will do that. We want to make sure that people do not get away with corruption.” --SABC--
