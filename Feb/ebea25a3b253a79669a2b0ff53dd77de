The Royal Armed Forces magazine said in its February edition that the military zone aims “to ensure consistency of the command, control and support among the Moroccan forces and to offer further flexibility and freedom of action when necessary.” Major General Mohammed Miqdad was appointed a commander of the new military zone, the magazine said. The publication, however, did not provide further details about the military zone. Morocco borders Algeria from the east and south with a border length of 1 559 kilometres. In August, Algeria severed diplomatic relations with Morocco, accusing Rabat of having "hostile tendencies." Morocco dismissed the accusations. Moroccan-Algerian ties have been tense for decades against the backdrop of the disputed Sahara region between Rabat and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front. --yenisafak.com--
