Theuns du Toit was suspended following the suspected racial incident as the university launched investigations into the matter. Scores of students held protests demanding swift action against the student. The university held a disciplinary hearing from May 15, concluding on June 23. On Thursday, the Central Disciplinary Committee (CDC) found the student guilty of contravening the university's disciplinary code for students. 

“The findings led the CDC to conclude that there is no alternative but to expel Theuns du Toit with immediate effect from the university,” the university said in a statement. The student has five days to appeal the decision. --BBC--
