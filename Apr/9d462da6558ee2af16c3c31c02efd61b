A new report shows that African countries increased their military expenditure by 1.2% in 2021, compared to 2020. This means that African countries spent $39.7 billion on military hardware, according to the report by SIPRI Fact Sheet, which monitors Arms Industry Database. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, African military spending followed three distinct trends. It first rose continuously between 2012 and 2014, followed by four years of decline until 2018, and then three consecutive years of growth until 2021, to give an overall increase of 2.5%. In 2021, North African military expenditure totalled $19.6 billion, 1.7% lower than in 2020, but 29% higher than in 2012. The long-standing tensions between the two largest spenders in North Africa, Algeria and Morocco, worsened in 2021. Algeria’s military expenditure fell by 6.1% in 2021, to reach $9.1 billion, while Morocco’s spending grew by 3.4%, to $5.4 billion. In 2021, military expenditure in sub-Saharan Africa totalled $20.1 billion, 4.1% higher than in 2020, but 14%lower than in 2012. The increase in 2021 was the first in sub-Saharan Africa since 2014 and was primarily driven by Nigeria, the biggest spender in the sub region. Between 2020 and 2021, Nigeria raised its military spending by 56%, to reach $4.5 billion. The increase came in response to Nigeria’s various security challenges, such as attacks by Islamist extremists and separatist insurgents. South Africa, the second-largest spender in the sub region, cut its military expenditure by 13%, to $3.3 billion in 2021. Kenya, Uganda and Angola were, respectively, the third, fourth and fifth largest military spenders in sub-Saharan Africa. The report says that after a 17%drop in military spending, Saudi Arabia fell from the fourth largest spender in 2020 to the eighth largest in 2021. Iran increased its military spending by 11%, making it the 14th largest military spender in 2021. This is the first time in 20 years that Iran has ranked among the top 15 military spenders. --TheEastAfrican--
