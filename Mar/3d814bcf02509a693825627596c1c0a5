LIFT Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Jonathan Ayache, says that last year was a challenging time for the travel and tourism industry especially for a new airline such as LIFT. The airline saw an increase in last minute bookings due to anxiety experienced by customers as a result of unforeseen travel restrictions. This is after South Africa’s Level 4 adjusted restrictions prohibiting inter-provincial travel for leisure to and from Gauteng. LIFT was the first airline in South Africa to launch full flexibility as a standard where tickets can be cancelled or changed with no fuss and at no extra charge up to 24hrs before the flight. Ayache reiterates in the effort of placing the client in the center of product offering as LIFT aims to provide better flexible options which are not only for your flight but accommodation through a partnership with service providers. According to The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) travelling is expected to surge in 2022 and possibly double by 2024. The airline foresees an increase in joint business and leisure travel, also known as bleisure travel. He explains that one of the things focused on is the expansion of networking as well as the amount of domestic and regional destinations.
