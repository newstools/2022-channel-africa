The finer print of the deal that saw the Takatso Consortium take a 51% shareholding in SAA last year represents a “contingent liability,” the Treasury said in a document emailed to Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts that was later withdrawn. That’s partly because Takatso, made up of a local jet-leasing company and private-equity firm, has the right to assess whether any ongoing liabilities in SAA be settled by the government, the Treasury said in the document seen byBloomberg. The sale of SAA was announced in June last year after the airline emerged from lengthy bankruptcy proceedings, during which its planes were grounded for well over a year and the workforce cut by 80%. The airline, which used to serve destinations across Africa and a number of major global cities, hasn’t made money since 2011 and received state bailouts that totalled billions of dollars. The National Treasury said it was not consulted on the sale of the stake and remains in the dark about a number of other agreements such as Takatso’s proposed issue of preference shares. It’s also concerned that government guarantees on SAA’s debt remain in place, according to the document. --Moneyweb--
