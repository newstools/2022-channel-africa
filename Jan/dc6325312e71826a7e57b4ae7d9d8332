The Sugar Directorate says Kenya had by October imported 201,530 tonnes of sugar against the required 210,163 tonnes, equivalent to 96% of the allocated quota. The Treasury in March slashed by a third the amount of sugar that can be imported duty-free to Kenya from Comesa countries as the government moved to tame influx of the sweetener following an outcry from farmers. The Treasury said imports that exceeded the set limit would attract 100% duty, effectively protecting farmers and local sugar processors from rogue importers. Kenya has been grappling with a shortage of sugar supply occasioned by disruption in production after breakdowns by some of the millers in western Kenya. This pushed up the wholesale price of sugar by 23%in November, one of the largest increments in recent months, with a 50kg bag selling at $54.3 up from $44.27 previously. --TheEastAfrican--
