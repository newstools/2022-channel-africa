Meanwhile, Nigeria became the only side to advance from the group stage with a perfect record after beating Guinea Bissau 2-0 at the Stade Omnisport Roumdé Adjia in Garoua. Failure to breach Nigeria’s defence also meant Guinea Bissau became the first team in history to go seven consecutive games in AFCON history without scoring a single goal. Nigeria finished top of Group D with nine points followed by Egypt with six then Sudan and Guinea Bissau in third and fourth, respectively, with one point each. The final set of group matches in the tournament are set to take place later today as teams jostle to confirm the qualification for the Round of 16. The standout fixture will see defending champions Algeria take on group leaders Côte d’Ivoire aiming to avoid a shock early exit from the tournament. The other group match, which will take place concurrently, pits Sierra Leone go up against Equatorial Guinea. In Group F, 2004 champions Tunisia play Gambia and Mali take on Mauritania. --Africa.cgtn.com--
