The army which took power in a coup in August 2020 had previously committed to holding democratic elections in February. Under its plan, a constitutional referendum would be held in 2023 and legislative elections in 2025. The junta called its proposal "appropriate to conduct the political and institutional reforms." The army has been in control in Mali since August 2020. In that time, the army has carried out two coups and postponed elections previously scheduled for next month that it had committed to holding. Mali's Foreign Minister, Abdoulaye Diop, submitted the government’s transition plans Saturday to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Diop forwarded the document despite a boycott of the national reform conference by political parties and nongovernmental organisations. ECOWAS has threatened sanctions on the country's military rulers for postponing the elections.  On January 9, ECOWAS will hold a summit in the Ghanaian capital of Accra on the situation in Mali.  --BBC--
