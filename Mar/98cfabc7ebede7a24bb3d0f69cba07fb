People’s interest follows reports published by the BBC indicating that the Ukrainian government is promising citizenship and $2000 to foreign nationals who are willing to join the country’s army following the Russian invasion. The BBC reports indicate that there is a sharp increase in demand among private military firms in Ukraine war. “Insiders say, demand is growing, amid a gut-wrenching war in Ukraine, United States and European private contractors say they are increasingly eying opportunities, ranging from ‘extraction’ missions to helping with logistics. Contractors are being hired for between $30 000 and $6 million to help remove people from Ukraine. “The higher-end figure is for whole groups of families wanting to leave with their assets”, reports the BBC while quoting experts and security specialists on the matter. However, there have been reports that Russia has also used hired mercenaries who were paid similar amounts. But comments monitored on several social media platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook show that some Malawians and retired soldiers are exploring ways to join the army of Ukraine. Nonetheless, there is no report of any Malawian in Ukraine fighting in the war. Earlier, photos circulated widely on social media of a Malawian man called Kumwenda as being in Ukraine to fight in the war for the $2000 daily cheque.  -- Jacob Tivane/ Channel Africa--
