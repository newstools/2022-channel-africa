Eguavoen’s side were defeated by Ghana in the playoffs on away goals following a 1-1 draw in Abuja on Tuesday, with the first leg having finished goalless. Thomas Partey’s 10th-minute goal did the damage despite William Troost-Ekong having equalised for Nigeria from the penalty spot 12 minutes later. Eguavoen had initially been handed the reins on an interim basis in December after the NFF decided to sack Gernot Rohr just one month before their Africa Cup of Nations campaign. However, the 56-year-old earned a permanent stay at the helm after the national team impressed during the African showpiece in Cameroon, where they reached the last 16. Nigerian football’s governing body has also subsequently withdrawn the contract offers made to the coaching staff in the wake of their AFCON exploits. “We thank the coaches and team officials for their service to the nation and wish them success in their future endeavours,” NFF General Secretary Dr Mohammed Sanusi said in a statement on Thursday. “A new crew will be announced after a proper review to lead the new charge of reinvigorating the Super Eagles to face future challenges appropriately,” the statement added.  --AllAfrica--
