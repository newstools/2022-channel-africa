A spokesperson for the ministry added however that the creditor committee, which will aim to oversee the restructuring of the southern African country’s external debt, was not yet formed and that the co-chairs were not confirmed either. Zambia became the first pandemic-era sovereign default in 2020, struggling with debt that has reached 120% of GDP.  

Its debt was $31.74 billion at the end of 2021, according to official government data of which $17.27 billion is external debt. “South Africa indicated its interest to co-Chair the Zambia Creditor Committee (ZCC)” the South African Treasury spokesperson said in an emailed statement. However, the ZCC has not yet been formed and has not yet confirmed the arrangement.” France runs the secretariat for the Paris Club, a forum of major creditor nations to discuss debt difficulties with debtor countries.
