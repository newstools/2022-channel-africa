The continent’s biggest lender by assets impressive increase saw it inch ahead of its South African compatriot, First National Bank (FNB), whose brand value also went up 18% to $1.581 billion. Standard Bank beat FNB to claim the title with a margin of just $2 million. Brand Finance Valuation Director Declan Ahern said that Standard Bank’s impressive performance comes off the back of hard work over the past few years, with the brand’s reputation steadily increasing since 2019. “The new brand positioning “It can be” announced mid-way through 2020, alongside continued diversification and adaptability, have clearly paid dividends. Overall, the performance of African brands has been overwhelmingly positive across the board this year, and highlights the impressive strides made by brands from the continent in recent years,”Ahern said.
