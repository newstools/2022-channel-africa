In a statement on Wednesday, Bintou Keita praised the UN forces and the national army for restoring calm in Nyiragongo and Rutshuru areas of North Kivu province, after two weeks of clashes with the rebels. Speaking from the province’s capital, Goma, the Guinean diplomat said ending the rebels' threat was possible with:
The M23 has called for the government to implement the Nairobi peace accords of 2013, but the government now calls the rebels a "terrorist group" and has ruled out new talks with them. In recent clashes with the group, 16 soldiers were killed and two UN forces injured, according to the UN. Nearly 100 000 civilians fled the fighting last week, but have been returning to their homes since early this week after M23 announced a retreat from areas it had captured. UN has more than 15 000 security forces the largest globally on mission to stabilise the volatile region of eastern DRC, home to more than 100 rebel groups. After more than 20 years of operation, the UN mission, Monusco, is widely criticised for having failed its mission against rebel groups and protecting civilians. --BBC--
