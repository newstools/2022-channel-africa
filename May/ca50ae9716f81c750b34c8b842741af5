The organisations noted that Nigerian youths lacked opportunities, finance and good economic opportunities to thrive; hence the need to mentor them to create alternative pathways that would keep them away from poverty and hunger. The disclosure comes after about 31 people lost their lives in Port Harcourt on Saturday while rushing to obtain free food from a new generation church. The Managing Director of PIND Foundation, Tunji Idowu, while speaking in Port Harcourt at the weekend during a mentoring session of 320 young professionals, expressed confidence that the initiative would reduce poverty and conflict in the region. He explained that the foundation had earlier trained and empowered 4 000 youths in Abia and Akwa Ibom states and was scaling up the number with additional 1000 in Rivers and other states in the region. --Guardian.ng--
