Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i said the school head teacher was arrested because the school buses were travelling past the stipulated time. School buses are not allowed to operate after 18:00. The bandits killed one of the drivers and injured several teachers who work at the high school located in Elgeyo Marakwet county, western Kenya. The students were travelling on Thursday night after a school trip. Police said an investigation had been launched into the incident. In August, the Kenyan government imposed a 60-day night curfew on parts of Baringo, West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties following increased inter-communal violence. --BBC--
