Codeco, whose full name is Congo Economic Development Co-operative, is one of the deadliest militia groups operating in eastern DRC. It was blamed for last month’s slaughter of around 50 civilians in a mining area. The group's decision to end hostilities was made on Monday following talks in Ituri province that brought together representatives of various ethnic groups, including leaders of the Lendu community that is linked to the rebels. “Codeco is going adhere to the peace process we hope that from today peace will be back in our province,” Célestin Tawara, a representative of the Lendu community was quoted as saying by the army. The truce came as army chiefs from the states that make up the East Africa Community met in Goma town to decide on a regional force to fight militia groups in eastern DRC. It is not yet announced when the force will start operations against rebel groups that will reject an offer to lay down their arms. More than 100 local and foreign groups operate in South Kivu, North Kivu and Ituri provinces. They have destabilised the region for more than two decades. --BBC--
