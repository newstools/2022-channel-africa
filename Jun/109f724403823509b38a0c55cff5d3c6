On Tuesday, Telkom’s share price lost 9.5% following the company’s more downbeat revenue and earnings forecasts, which are the result of a slowdown in growth in its mobile business and the continuous decline of its fixed-line business. Telkom entered the mobile space in 2010 and has grown to become the country's third-biggest network operator, with almost 17 million active mobile clients. Its mobile revenue has also expanded fast, of late supported by the lockdown period, which boosted demand in connectivity due to a shift to work from home. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Telkom grew mobile service revenue by over 40% in the nine months to the end of December. But in the year to end-March, its mobile business revenue growth cooled to only 6%. Serame Taukobong, who took over as Telkom CEO in January, says that while this had not set off alarm bells, the company needs to improve the performance of the segment. "Stabilising the performance of our mobile business and rapidly expanding our fibre business to make sure that we remain at the forefront is one of our focus areas for the medium term," he said.
