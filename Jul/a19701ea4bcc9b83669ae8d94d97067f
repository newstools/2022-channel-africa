In the interview, Chikuka said he couldn't blame Video Assistant Referee for calling the referee to view the incident, but the Ethiopian referee was the one at fault for failing to interpret penalty rules correctly. "Abebe should shoulder the responsibility and accept that she failed to interpret the penalty rule effectively. “We know that the results cannot be nullified, but we only hope the Confederation of African Football (CAF) will sanction Abebe," he said. The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) has lodged a complaint to CAF over Abebe’s performance during their WAFCON 2022 semi-final clash against Banyana Banyana. A goal from Linda Motlhalo from the penalty spot in the additional time secured the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations for the Banyana Banyana against Zambia. The decision by Abebe was not welcomed in Zambia as FAZ announced a complaint to CAF over her performance. -- Namuchana Namuchana--
