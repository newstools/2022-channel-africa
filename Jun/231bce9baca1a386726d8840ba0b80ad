The 19-year-old was injured during the 100m at the Kip Keino Classic continental tour meeting in Kenya on May 7, pulling up and failing to finish the race. Her coach Henk Botha confirmed that she has not recovered from the issue which he told BBC Sport Africa at the time would rule her out for at least three weeks. She will now be absent from the African Championships, which begin on  8 June in Mauritius. Mboma, who is the reigning BBC African Sport Personality of the Year, is currently Africa's highest-rated sprinter after an impressive 2021 season which saw her claim the Diamond League trophy and the junior World title over 200m in addition to silver at the Tokyo Olympics. Her attentions will now turn to regaining fitness ahead of the World Athletics Championships next month. The World Athletics Championships begin on July 15 in Oregon, United States, with the Commonwealth Games starting on July 8 in Birmingham, England. --BBC--
