Indeni were beaten 5-0 by Power on April 10 to see the Ndola club stay put at the top end of the bottom four relegation zone at number 15 on 31 points with four games left to play. Club secretary Andrew Choolwe said assistant Frank Miti will be in interim charge of the team. “So for now, the executive has decided that we are not partying ways with the coach (Dabid) but we will get our guys from within to drill the team in the remaining four matches,” Choolwe said. Chilufya’s contract ends this June after signing a short-term deal with the Ndola club in November when he returned for a second spell to replace the man who beat last Sunday Mwenya Chipepo who was earlier headhunted by Power last October. Ironically, Chilufya has left Indeni in the same spot he found them in at number 15 when they had 11 points from ten rounds of matches played. --AllAfrica--
