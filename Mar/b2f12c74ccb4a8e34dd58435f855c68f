Angolan analysts, however, also noted that trade between the two countries is currently minimal and thus the impact should not be great. Diamond exports to Russia, valued in 2019 at just over $29 million, may however face payment difficulties. The European Union announced on Wednesday the expulsion of seven Russian banks from the system, although two major banks were not included because they were involved in transactions concerning the sale of oil and gas. The SWIFT transfer system brings together more than 11 000 financial institutions from over 200 countries and in January alone carried out around 50 million financial transactions a day. "SWIFT is a code that works for international transactions as a kind of IBAN in national bank transfers," explains Sakaneno, adding that "when there is a transfer from one country to another the value of the transfer does not go directly to the recipient's account, for this to happen there has to be a corresponding bank and to make the transfer operational this SWIFT code is used. --ChannelAfrica--
