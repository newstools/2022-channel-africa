Just over a week ago, the Gupta brothers were arrested in Dubai.

Their arrest was ordered by Interpol in March in response to a red notice aimed at identifying them as suspected money launderers and fraudsters.

According to Lamola, they want to complete this process as quickly as possible, but explained that extradition can be a lengthy process.
