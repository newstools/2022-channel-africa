Nyathi is the Zimbabwean man who was brutally killed and set alight by an angry mob in Diepsloot, South Africa last week. He was attacked by a vigilante group looking for suspected criminals. He was beaten, stoned and set alight a metres from his home. Speaking at his burial on Saturday in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city, his uncle, Mpthathisi Ndlovu, said: "It is our wish to see the people, who did this, be apprehended. No person deserves to die the way Elvis did." Nyathi was given a state-assisted funeral; all expenses incurred were paid for by the government of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's minister of state for provincial affairs in Bulawayo, Judith Ncube, speaking on behalf of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, said Nyathi's death was a very painful experience for the country. "As a country, we have been extremely hurt by what happened to Elvis," she said.
