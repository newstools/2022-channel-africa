The Kenyan athlete is aboard Qatar Airlines flight QR 1336 which departed from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at 6:10 pm Eastern African Time and is due in Portland in the United States at 10.30 am local time, which is two and a half hours before the start of the 100 metres preliminaries. Omanyala’s delayed travel to the United States was occasioned by a delay in the processing of his visa. Omanyala further noted that visa challenges are faced by all Kenyans and people daily, and he is not an exemption. --ChannelAfrica--
