Reverend Father John Mark Cheitnum’s decomposing body was found on Tuesday, four days after he was seized by gunmen. The other priest was freed after a ransom was paid and has been reunited with his family. The Christian clerics were seized at gunpoint at a rectory in the village of Yadin Garu in Kaduna after having travelled there for a church event. The kidnappers had demanded a large ransom while the police had said efforts were underway to rescue them. Buhari said he was "deeply disturbed by the murder". He said the armed groups behind the spate of kidnappings of Christian clerics "seem to be bent on creating chaos and disorder in the country". --BBC--
