More than 200 Kenyans were stranded in Ukraine due to Russia's invasion, a press release from the bloc stated. "The EU regrets the incorrect and skewed media reporting on this issue that has repeatedly appeared in various Kenyan outlets and social media, and calls for careful verification of the facts," the press release said. "Given that in some cases deliberate disinformation is being spread, the EU Embassies present in Kenya are ready to provide accurate data," it continued. Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania have granted unrestricted access to those fleeing the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, including Kenyans, the delegation said. "Contrary to some media reports, those Kenyans who have arrived at the borders have been assisted and allowed to enter safely into EU Member States," the statement continued. Numerous African students in Ukraine have shared stories of being blocked by Ukrainian security agents from leaving the country. Ukraine is not a member of the EU. The African Union has condemned the reports of discrimination. The EU mission to Kenya said that out of 350 000 refugees who crossed into Poland between February 24 and 28, there were "7 721 Africans, including 88 Kenyans". It added that an extra 4 150 people from 40 African countries have crossed into Slovakia in the last four days. --BBC--
