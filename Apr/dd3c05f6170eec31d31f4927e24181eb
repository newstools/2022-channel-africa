The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-operation, Veronica Macamo, says she is ascertaining the real reasons for the decision. Madeira has been special representative of the head of the African Union Commission in Somalia since 2015. For his part, the Somali President, Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo, said he did not authorise any action against Madeira and stressed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dealing with diplomatic affairs did not communicate to his representative any acts against the country's sovereignty. --ChannelAfrica--
