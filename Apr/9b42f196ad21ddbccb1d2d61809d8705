Twitter Chief Executive Officer, Parag Agrawal reportedly told employees in an internal meeting that he didn't know which direction the platform would go in once the deal was closed. “I think it will fundamentally change, this is Elon Musk taking a public company private, so he is the king of twitter he can do whatever he wants to with it”, Agrawal said. He said Musk has immense influence on what is quite frankly the most influential political platform in the world. “If you want to see the latest from politicians or world leaders you go on to twitter, and that is now all owned by the world's richest man. So there are a lot of questions there about whether someone who is so powerful already should be allowed to have even more power”, Agrawal said. Musk's move has raised hopes about the commercial potential of Twitter, which has struggled to achieve profitable growth despite its important spot in culture and politics.  --BBC--
