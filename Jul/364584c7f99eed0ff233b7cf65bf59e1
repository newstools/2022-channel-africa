According to Sidat, the two discussed several issues including, FIFA’s support for the FIFA Forward project taking place in Mozambique, support for the provincial development projects, and FIFA’s support for African countries. Post the meeting, speaking on Fifa’s support for African countries Sidat said: “We know that there is a big difference between the African continent and the other continents. Many players from the African continent are playing in Europe, they’re in France and other countries. “We need to find a balance and preserve the quality of African football, in terms of finances as well. What do we have to do? Create more competition, more competition to attract more players to play in Africa and not leave Africa to play in Europe.” -- Francis Mutegi/Channel Africa--
