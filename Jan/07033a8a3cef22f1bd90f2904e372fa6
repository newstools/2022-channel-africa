Massmart, a subsidiary of United States multinational retailer Walmart, which in 2020 announced a turnaround plan to stabilise performance, said on Friday that total group sales dropped by 1.9% compared to the same period the prior year. Forty-three stores were damaged during the July unrest in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. In November, the retailer estimated that the total replacement cost for property and stock damages as a result of the civil unrest to be $160 million. With local and global supply chain shortages, coupled with the two Makro stores impacted by the riots in KwaZulu-Natal, this resulted in general merchandise sales, its second-largest sales category, being 9.7%lower in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, Massmart said Makro had performed strongly with $1.9 billion in sales, 6.6% higher compared to the previous year, while comparable sales were 10.6% higher. And despite the Covid-19 pandemic liquor restrictions, Massmart’s liquor sales saw a comparable sales growth of 39.8%. Also doing well was Builders, with total sales of $960 million, 7.1% higher, while comparable sales increased by 5.2%. But Game stores continued to perform poorly as total sales of $980 million slid 8.1%, while comparable sales were 5.6% lower. The total South African store sales were 6.9% lower, while comparable South African store sales were 3.7% lower. Business activity in the hospitality and catering sector also remained at lower than normal levels, as this industry was impacted by various levels of trading restrictions as well as international travel restrictions during the year, Massmart said. --IOL--
