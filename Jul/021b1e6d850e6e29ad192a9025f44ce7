Twenty-six-year-old Lu is being accused of exploiting children in Lilongwe and Mchinji districts after an investigative BBC report. The State has asked the court that in the meantime Susu, as he is popularly called, should be kept at Maula Prison in the capital city, Lilongwe, pending court proceedings. During proceedings, Lu complained before the court that ever since he got into the country he only had one meal. But the State also objected to the bail application, saying his life will be in danger and that he might interfere with evidence. He was on the run until he was arrested in Chipata province in Zambia. Lu was extradited to Malawi last week to answer child abuse and exploitation charges. --George Mhango/Channel Africa--
