The suspension of the flights is with effect from this morning until the airline successfully secures additional funding. The company's business rescue practitioners have advised that the process to raise the necessary capital is in progress. Comair says it remains confident that funding will be secured. In a statement released last night the company says once funding is received, the airline will be able to recommence operations. Both British Airways and kulula.com ticket sales have also been suspended with immediate effect. Comair Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Orsmond said company did everything to avoid the suspension. He says Comair, the BRPs and the lenders are working hard to get the funding in place to allow for the resumption of normal flight schedule as soon as possible.  --SABC--
