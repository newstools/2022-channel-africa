Togolese Foreign Minister Robert Dussey confirmed that the President and his government are ready to facilitate a fruitful dialogue between Mali, and the International Community. Abdoulaye Diop, Mali’s Foreign Minister, conveyed President Colonel Assimi Goïta's request during a two-day visit to Lome. The Malian authorities ask for help after failing to convince regional partners to welcome their two-year transition proposal. Despite multiple trips to Bamako by Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) Mali crisis mediator, Goodluck Jonathan, the two parties didn't find a common ground. Ecowas demanded the holding of elections within a 12 to 16 months’ period but Malian authorities have so far refused, despite pressure and sanctions- citing security concerns. The regional body has yet to comment the Mali-Togo mediation proposal. Malian troops have been fighting a jihadist insurgency in large portions of the territory. In 2013, they were joined by European troops but the insurgency was never fully quelled and it extended in neighboring countries. --AfricaNews--
