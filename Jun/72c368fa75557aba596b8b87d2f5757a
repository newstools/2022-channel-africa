“We’re pioneering for Africa but also pioneering for multilateral development banks,” which can complement and magnify the work of the IMF, AfDB Chief Financial Officer Hassatou Diop N’Sele said in an interview in Ghana’s capital, Accra. The IMF injected a record $650 billion into the global fiscal system last year to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus by releasing special drawing rights to its member states. Allocations were based on predetermined quotas, which take into account the size of countries’ economies and other factors, meaning just $33 billion went to the 54 African nations, as much as France and Italy combined, and less than half of what the United States received. “The main challenge for MDBs is to devise vehicles that meet the needs of potential contributors, including with regard to preserving the reserve asset quality of claims to be received in exchange for channelled SDRs,” Nicolas Mombrial, an IMF spokesperson, said in response to questions. Rich nations want to be able to account for the SDRs internally as reserves, even after on-lending them to multilateral lenders, an aspect the IMF is advising on. “Ultimately, the decision on whether and how to channel SDRs to MDBs rests with the countries that hold these SDRs,” Mombrial said. The African lender is also considering creating so-called “security-indexed bonds” to promote peace and allowing its African Development Fund, which mostly provides grants to the most vulnerable economies, to tap capital markets. “When you don’t have resources, you have to be creative and try and leverage your balance sheet,” N’Sele said. --Bloomberg--
