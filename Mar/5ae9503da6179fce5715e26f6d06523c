The defending champions missed six chances in the field, conceded 23 runs in wides, then made a mess of chasing 226 for their second loss in as many games. They were given hope by a ninth-wicket stand of 61 between Kate Cross and Sophie Ecclestone, only for Cross to be run out backing-up for 27. That left nine to win and, one run later, number 11 Anya Shrubsole was bowled by Anisa Mohammed to give West Indies their first win over England at the World Cup. West Indies had earlier been reduced from 81-0 to 98-4, before a stand of 123 between Shemaine Campbelle and Chedean Nation lifted them to 225-6. And, even though West Indies dropped three catches of their own, they ultimately squeezed England for a famous win. With the top four from the eight-team group going through to the semi-finals, England's defence of the trophy they won in 2017 is far from over, but they now have little margin for error. Their next game is against South Africa in Tauranga on Monday. West Indies add this scalp to their victory over hosts New Zealand and are in a strong position for a tilt on the semi-finals. --BBC--
