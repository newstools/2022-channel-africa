The shutdown of the Natref refinery in Sasolburg in the country’s Free State province sparked concerns of petrol and diesel shortages in the country where 60% of fuel products are imported. Sasol, however, said it did not expect any shortages. Sasol is the only producer of petroleum products in the country through its two refineries, one in Secunda in the Mpumalanga province, with an output of around 150 000 barrels per day (bpd) and Natref, at around 108 000 bpd. "The crude tanker has arrived in Durban and cargo dispatches are underway. Natref should start up to run at maximum production capability by end of July 2022," Sasol said in the statement. --Reuters--
