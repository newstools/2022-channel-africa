Twitter famously served as a megaphone for former United States (US) President Donald Trump before the platform banned him, and Musk, a self-proclaimed "free-speech absolutist", has said he wants to reform what he sees as the platform's over-zealous content moderation. "Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," Musk said in a statement released by Twitter. "I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans." However, advocacy groups were wary of the type of content Musk might allow on the platform, and Derrick Johnson, President of The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People civil rights organization, tweeted, "Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, misinformation or disinformation. Protecting our democracy is of utmost importance." At the White House, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said "no matter who owns or runs Twitter," President Joe Biden, himself a Twitter user, is "concerned about the power of large social media platforms." Musk bought a 9% stake in Twitter earlier in April, then offered to buy the whole company outright, citing a mission of preserving free speech. --TheEastAfrican--
