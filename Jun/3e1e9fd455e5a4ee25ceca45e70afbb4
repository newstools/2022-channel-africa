Scenes of people carrying machetes while hunting for Tutsis in the capital, Kinshasa, and other major towns circulated on social media over the weekend. Audio and video clips were also shared that identified the whereabouts of Tutsis. The attacks come amid rising tensions between DRC and neighbouring Rwanda. DRC accuses Rwanda of backing Congolese rebels and has halted all trade and co-operation agreements. Rwanda has denied supporting the M23 rebel group, a Tutsi-led group. Last week, an anti-Rwanda demonstration resulted in the looting of Rwandan-owned shops in the eastern town of Goma.
