The producer of Dunhill, Camel and Lucky Strike reported a 7% increase in full-year adjusted revenue to £25.7 billion($35 million) when it released its preliminary results for the year ended December 31, 2021. BAT reported a £2 billion($3 billion) share buyback programme for 2022. It also announced a small dividend increase of just 1% to 217.8 pence. Total sales were £25.7 billion($35 million), down 0.4%, with pre-tax profits up from £8.6 billion($12 billion) to £9.2 billion($12.44 billion) in the year. While the company’s cigarettes remained its biggest sellers, up £22 billion($30 billion) last year, but 3.2% lower on last year, BAT Chief Executive Jack Bowles said last year the business had delivered on its transformation journey. “We accelerated new category revenue, with growth of over 50%, and reached a total of 18.3 million consumers, from 13.5 million up 4.8 million, of our non-combustible products. New category losses reduced for the first time, contributing to earnings growth,” he said. The growth in consumers of non-combustible products was the company’s strongest to date. Non-combustible products now account for 12% of group revenues, up from 4% in 2017. In 2019, the leading tobacco company revealed it was creating three global brands for its new category product portfolio. New categories included Vuse for vapour products, Velo for modern oral products, and Glo for tobacco heating products. Bowles said the company was on a path to deliver £5 billion($7 billion) of revenue and profitability from new categories by 2025, and was developing opportunities beyond nicotine, leveraging its knowledge and capabilities from new categories. Of note, vapour revenue rose by 59%, Glo revenue was up 46%, and Modern Oral revenue increased by 41%. BAT expected global tobacco industry volumes to slip by roughly 2.5% this year. Last year, BAT bought a 20% stake in a Canadian company, Organigram, which produces marijuana for medical and recreational use. BAT said it was also committed to the environmental, social, and governance targets it had set. “These include becoming carbon-neutral across our operations, scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, and net-zero across our value chain by 2050,” BAT said. BAT said its outlook for 2022 included that it expected global tobacco industry volumes to decrease by about 2.5% in 2022, constant currency revenue growth of 3-5%, strong new category revenue growth and a further reduction in losses, and high single-figure constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth, with growth second-half weighted. Transnational foreign exchange is expected to be broadly neutral on full-year adjusted EPS growth and operating cash-flow conversion in excess of 90%. On Friday, BAT also announced board changes. It said Krishnan “Kandy” Anand would join the board as an independent non-executive director and member of the nominations and remuneration committees with effect from today. Kandy is the Chief Executive of Igniting Business Growth. BAT also announced that Marion Helmes would step down from the board with effect from the conclusion of the annual general meeting on April 28 and not stand for re-election. Its share price on Friday closed 1.59% higher at R687($45). --BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE--
