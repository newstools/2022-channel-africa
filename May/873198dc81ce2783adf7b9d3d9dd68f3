It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack on Wednesday against residents of the rural commune of Madjoari, said Colonel Hubert Yameogo, the Governor of the East Region. Militants linked to al Qaeda have overrun swathes of Burkina Faso in recent years, part of a wider insurgency across West Africa’s semi-arid Sahel region. Wednesday’s attack followed two others this month in Madjoari. One killed 17 civilians and another killed 11 soldiers. Army officers overthrew Burkina Faso’s president in January, complaining about worsening violence. --Reuters--
