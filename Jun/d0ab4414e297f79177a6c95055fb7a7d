The newly appointed ambassador, Michael Gonzalez, is expected to arrive in the country next month following his confirmation by the US Congress. In 2019, the US recalled its then ambassador Daniel Foote after he said that he was "horrified" that a judge had sentenced a gay couple to 15 years in prison. Zambia accused Foote of trying to dictate policy, and the President at the time, Edgar Lungu, declared him persona non grata. On Tuesday, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema bade farewell to the outgoing US chargé d'affaires Martin Dale, assuring of a commitment to strengthen the long-standing relations between the two countries. --BBC--
