In a statement his office said an additional 70 protesters from the pro-democracy Hirak movement, who are awaiting trial for public order offences, would be offered clemency. Among those released was a rights campaigner, Zaki Hannache, who was arrested in February for allegedly promoting terrorist acts and spreading false news. The Hirak protests rocked major cities in Algeria starting in early 2019, forcing long-time President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down months later. Protests continued even after Tebboune came to power. He was rejected by the Hirak who regarded him as an extension of the old political system. --BBC--
