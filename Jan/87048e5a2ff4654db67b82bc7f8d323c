Lourenço said it was shameful that the national business community had been unable to access a credit line of US$1 billion with Germany's Deutsche Bank, which was opened three years ago. In an interview with five media selected by the Angolan presidency on Thursday, 6, Lourenço said that the opposition is "worse than in previous elections" and because he knows that it cannot win the MPLA UNITA has resorted to a coalition. "This only means saying that, perhaps, they are worse than they were a few years ago, in the previous elections," said the President when questioned about the United Patriotic Front launched by UNITA, BD and the Pra-Já Servir Angola project, and recalled that in the 1992 elections "they said that MPLA had no chance, for the simple fact that, until that time, it had been a single party." Still with regard to the opposition, particularly UNITA, Lourenço estimated that "there continues to be this bad evaluation of the theatre of operations". Despite having pointed from the very first hour to the fight against corruption as one of the main objectives of his mandate, which is in the last year, the Angolan Head of State said today that the diversification of the economy and the creation of a good business environment are the axes of his governance, but that the fight against corruption "is a requirement for a good business environment" in Angola. In terms of business, he said it was "a shame" that Angolan businesspeople had not taken advantage of a credit line opened three years ago at Germany's Deutsche Bank, worth $1 billion. "What image are we sending abroad?” Lourenço asked and challenged Angolan companies to organise themselves in order to access this money to invest in the national economy.  On the other hand, Lourenço denied that the process of privatisation of companies and the awarding of contracts were benefiting companies close to power, as has been pointed out by the opposition and several observers.  --Channel Africa--
