According to the Tunisian Finance Minister Sihem Boughdiri, the 2022 finance law boosts spending by over 3% year on year to $19.8 billion. This will bring government’s debt to 82.6% of GDP. Tunisia has suffered years of economic woes due to covid-19, with high inflation and unemployment at around 18%. Foreign debt in 2021 hit 100% of GDP. Boughdiri confirmed the government is also hoping to reach a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). "Negotiations with the IMF will restart at the beginning of 2022." Tunisia's previous government had been in talks with the IMF over a new bailout package. A deal with the global lender could entail politically painful reforms, such as cutting subsidies on basic goods or tackling the wage bill of a public sector that employs some 680 000 of the country's 12 million inhabitants. --AfricaNews--
