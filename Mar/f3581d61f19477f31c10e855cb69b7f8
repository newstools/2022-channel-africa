The blockade of the exports, estimated at nearly $87.5 million annually, came after major container and shipping lines temporarily suspended cargo shipments to and from Russia in response to the sanctions. Excluding Russian banks from Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the international payment system, and its central bank from international operations has made it harder for the country to pay for imports and receive cash for exports. SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments and its instructions are typically honoured without question, making international trade flow smoothly. The exclusion of Russian banks from SWIFT will make it riskier and more expensive for Kenyan exporters, halting exports like spices, nuts and vegetables to Russia. Russia’s assault on its neighbour is the biggest state-to-state invasion in Europe since World War Two, prompting suctions from the United States, Britain and European Union. Russia is largely seen as a growth market for Kenya’s sluggishly growing exports. Tea is the leading export while Kenya’s coffee enters the country as re-exports from other countries. --TheEastAfrican--
