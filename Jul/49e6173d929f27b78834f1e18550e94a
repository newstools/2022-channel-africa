Data released by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) shows that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased to 7.4% in June from 6.5% in May this year. The main driver of inflation in South Africa has come from higher food and fuel prices. Consumers are set to face further price pressures after municipal rates also increased this month. Food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 8.6% year-on-year, contributing 1.5 percentage points to the total CPI annual rate of 7.4%. Housing and utilities increased by 5.1% year-on-year, contributing 1.2 percentage points. Transport increased by 20.0% year-on-year, contributing 2.7 percentage points. Miscellaneous goods and services increased by 4.0% year-on-year, contributing 0.6 of a percentage point. Stats SA further says in June, the annual inflation rate for goods was 11%, up from 9.5% in May; and for services it was 3.9% up from 3.6% in May. Meanwhile, Economist Dr Azar Jammine says the Reserve Bank needs to take drastic action as inflation rises higher than it wants it to be. Jammine says the bank is in a tight spot as it prepares to make an announcement on the repo rate this Thursday through the Monetary Policy Committee.  --SABC-- South African consumer #inflation reached a 13-year high in June, registering at 7,4%.
