Roodts says the speech must be considered positive. The statement comes after Godongwana, in his maiden budget speech yesterday, announced that a new business bounce-back scheme will come into effect in March to support small-to-medium enterprises that have suffered distress due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, Roodts says it is also important for citizens to understand that there are significant potential obstacles that may occur, but for now, the existing strategies are achievable. The Minister allocated $57 million (R8.7 billion) to the South African Police Service budget. The Efficient Group Chief Economist notes that giving money to the police services won’t make much of a difference because the government is not effective and efficient in fighting crime. “It is not a matter of money, it is mostly a matter of efficiency in government that they are lacking. The reason is that people are being appointed not because they are experts but because of political connections.” He says more money is not necessarily going to fix most of the problems in the country, however, government needs competent people in the right places. Adding to the stance to hold municipalities accountable, Roodts says a lot, in terms of service delivery, has deteriorated rapidly in South Africa. “We could have done much more when financial capacity was available, but now we ran out of the financial capacity and we don’t have the resources anymore.” He says it will be surprising to see a dramatic turnaround in terms of service delivery in South Africa. According to Roodts, government normally speaks about unemployment in the country but they do nothing to improve it. He says the Finance Minister is making more funds available for so-called youth employment programmes but such is not the answer to unemployment. --Bomkazi Malobola/ ChannelAfrica--
