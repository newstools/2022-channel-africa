British Petroleum and United States-listed Kosmos Energy are leading development of GTA and Yakaar-Teranga, Senegal's first natural gas projects. 

"We are working to reach an FID by September for the phase 2 at GTA that should double expected production from 2.5 million tons per annum to 5 million tons per annum," Mamadou Fall Kane, an advisor to President Macky Sall, told Reuters. The first phase of GTA, which straddles the border between Senegal and Mauritania, will deliver its first gas by the end of 2023, said Kane. He said a recent European Union decision to label gas investments as climate-friendly would make it easier to attract financing. German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said in May that Germany wants to pursue gas and renewable projects with Senegal as the war in Ukraine forces it to look to diversify its sources of energy. --Reuters--
