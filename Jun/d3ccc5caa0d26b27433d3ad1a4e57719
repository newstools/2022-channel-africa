Osama Rabie added, during a TV interview, that 80 ships passed through the Canal on Monday, and the number is targeted to reach 100 ships per day. The Head of the Suez Canal Authority revealed that the tonnage of the 80 ships that crossed the Suez Canal, Monday, is 2 million tons, adding that if there was no new Suez Canal, the number of ships transiting would have decreased. “It is expected to achieve $7 billion in revenues during 2022,” Rabie added. Rabie denied the validity of the interference of any non-Egyptian administration in the Suez Canal, pointing out that since the Egyptians restarted the Suez Canal, 900 000 ships passed with revenues of $131 billion. The SCA Head indicated that the Ukrainian war crisis had a positive impact on the transit of the Suez Canal, and the canal was able to achieve higher revenues than last year and increased traffic. The Suez Canal achieved the highest monthly revenue in its history during May, marking an increase of 23% on a year on year basis, to reach $657 million, according to Rabie.  --EgyptToday--
