A suspected former leader of the pro-government Janjaweed militia has been charged with 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman will be the first person to be tried by the ICC over a conflict that left about 300 thousand people dead and more than two million homeless. Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir has so far evaded arrest over the conflict. He is wanted on charges of genocide and war crimes, which he denies the charges. He is currently in custody in Sudan after being ousted in a coup in 2019. He is alleged to have participated in attacks on civilians in four towns in Darfur between August 2003 and March 2004. --BBC--
