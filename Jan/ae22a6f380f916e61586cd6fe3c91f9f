This strike will last until the 26 and aims to continue putting pressure on the Government for the revision of the salary cap. The Ministry of Education has not given any answers to the claim booklet delivered by Sinptenu in February 2021. The union, which considers it a shame that a teacher receives 69 000 kwanzas ($130), proposes salaries of between 400 000 kwanzas ($750) and 1 million kwanzas ($1 750) between 13th and 1st grade, for technical staff salaries of between 200 000 kwanzas ($350) and 300 000 kwanzas ($500) and, for non-technical staff, salaries of 120 000 kwanzas ($235) and for cleaning assistants salaries of 100 000 kwanzas ($175). The list of demands has other points. The Ministry of Education has yet to make a statement. --ChannelAfrica--
